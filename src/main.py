text = """Question: Develop a comprehensive Clarity smart contract for the Stacks blockchain that enables a decentralized borrowing system centered on STX tokens, permitting users to submit collateral, secure loans against it, and partake in yield generation. The contract must include mechanisms to manage contributions through personalized account balances, a loan framework with adaptive interest calculations tied to block intervals, and functionality to distribute interest proceeds to participants. Enforce a 50% loan-to-value restriction, a 10% fixed interest rate, and robust error management for situations such as over-borrowing, insufficient collateral, or repayment failures. Implement accessible read-only methods for displaying user-specific balances and total active loan obligations, while adhering to secure STX transfer protocols leveraging standard contract-based transaction guidelines. Deliver thorough explanatory annotations detailing the role and operation of every data structure and function within the contract.  

CoT: I will outline a reasoning process for constructing the specified Clarity smart contract.  

First, the task involves designing a decentralized borrowing system focused on STX, with core features including deposit management, interest-bearing loans, and yield distribution. Key datasets—user deposits and loan accounts—warrant structured storage. Maps are chosen to track depositors’ balances (principals to STX amounts) and borrowers’ outstanding loans (principals to [loan amount, last interaction block height]).  

Persistent variables like total-allocations (aggregating deposited STX) and reserve-pool (collecting accrued interest) support interest distribution. Fixed loan parameters (e.g., 10% annualized rate) and error codes for undercollateralization or repayment discrepancies enhance usability and security.  

The deposit process uses stx-transfer? to securely transfer funds to the contract, updating both user maps and total-allocations. Borrow operations first verify compliance with 50% collateralization using (/ deposited-amount u2) before issuing new loans. Existing loan interest accumulates via a calculation based on elapsed blocks, ensuring dynamic interest compounding.  

Repayment functions compute total due (principal + accrued interest) and isolate interest portions to enrich the reserve-pool, ensuring proper reallocation for yield calculations. Yield claimants receive allocations proportional to their contribution to total-allocations, reinforcing fairness.  

Read-only interfaces like user-balance and owed-amount enable transparency, allowing participants to assess their positions without state modifications.  

A critical review identifies a potential omission in the borrowing logic: the existing implementation may neglect to aggregate new loan requests with existing liabilities before enforcing the LTV cap. This oversight could permit users to exceed collateral limits inadvertently.  

Ultimately, the design aligns with the requirements: STX-based deposits, adaptive interest via block intervals, proportional yield rewards, and intentional contract security. Error cases—such as failed transfers or over-pledged loans—are addressed with predefined codes, and the protocol employs established STX transaction methods to minimize vulnerabilities."""
