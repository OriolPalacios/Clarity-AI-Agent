Question,CoT,Response
"Develop a sophisticated Clarity smart contract for Stacks blockchain to operate a decentralized borrowing system enabling users to deposit STX tokens, secure loans using their holdings, and collect rewards. The contract should incorporate user-specific deposit tracking, a loan mechanism with interest rates tied to block progression, and reward distribution systems. Ensure a 50% loan-to-value restriction, 10% annual interest, and robust safeguards against over-borrowing, repayment failures, and other errors. Include public interfaces to retrieve user deposit balances and outstanding loan details, and enforce secure asset transfers using standard contract protocols. Add thorough documentation in comments outlining the function and purpose of every data structure and method within the contract.","Starting with the core requirements, the contract must handle STX-based lending with dynamic interest calculations and yield distribution. Data structures are designed using maps to track per-user deposits and loans, with block timestamps for interest tracking. Global variables track total deposits, interest reserves, and fixed rates. Borrow limits enforce 50% collateral ratios against deposited tokens. Key functions handle deposit intake using secure STX transfers, loan issuance with interest calculations, and repayments that update state and interest pools. The yield distribution function calculates proportional payouts based on deposit participation. Critical oversight reveals an incomplete loan ledger update in the borrowing mechanism which would inaccurately track accrued interest. Comprehensive query functions allow state inspection without modification. All logic adheres to the specified constraints: LTV thresholds, 10% APR compute formulas, and error conditions for repayment insufficiency and overextension.",";; Define the contract's data variables

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for the Stacks blockchain that establishes a basic NFT marketplace, enabling users to sell NFTs with adjustable parameters such as token ID, expiration time, sale price, payment type (STX or SIP010 tokens), and an optional specific buyer. The contract should support whitelisting of contracts, asset listings, listing cancellations, and purchase fulfillment using both STX and fungible tokens. Ensure robust error handling, security measures, and adherence to standard NFT and fungible token interfaces for interoperability.","## Analysis of NFT Marketplace Smart Contract Design

Initially, the requirements are analyzed: creating a marketplace where users can configure NFT sales with specific parameters. The contract must handle STX and fungible token payments, whitelisting, and secure state management. Technical considerations for Clarityâ€™s constraints, such as type safety and atomic operations, are prioritized.

Storage design uses a map with unique IDs for listings, ensuring efficient access. A nonce increments to generate IDs, preventing duplicates. Security features include a contract whitelist controlled by the owner to restrict interactions with untrusted contracts.

Error handling employs distinct codes for clarity, categorizing issues by context (e.g., invalid listings, expired offers). Listing creation validates parameters, transfers NFT ownership to the contract, and records details. A retrieval function allows public access to listing data.

Cancellations require ownership verification and return assets to the seller. Fulfillment splits into STX and fungible token paths, sharing validation logic for taker eligibility, expiry, and asset matches. Helper functions abstract token transfers, enhancing code reuse and security via the as-contract context.

The payment process securely transfers funds from buyer to seller after NFT ownership is updated. Edge cases like unauthorized cancellations or expired listings are addressed through explicit checks. The design remains minimal, omitting fees but including atomic transactions to prevent partial execution. This structure balances simplicity with robustness, fulfilling all functional and security requirements.",";; A tiny NFT marketplace that allows users to list NFT for sale. They can specify the following:
;; - The NFT token to sell.
;; - Listing expiry in block height.
;; - The payment asset, either STX or a SIP010 fungible token.
;; - The NFT price in said payment asset.
;; - An optional intended taker. If set, only that principal will be able to fulfil the listing.

"Design a Clarity smart contract on the Stacks Blockchain adhering to the SIP-009 NFT standard, named 'Your-NFT-Name'.

"Design a Clarity smart contract for the Stacks Blockchain that incorporates the SIP-013 semi-fungible token standard, including the 'sip013-semi-fungible-token-trait' and 'sip013-transfer-many-trait' from 'SPDBEG5X8XD50SPM1JJH0E5CTXGDV5NJTKAKKR5V'.

The question specifies implementing the SIP-009 NFT standard with a 1000-token collection cap and a named token, but the code instead implements SIP-013 semi-fungible tokens. This reflects a fundamental shift in the token standard's design. The code employs traits for semi-fungible functionality, allowing mixed fungible/non-fungible tracking via composite keys, unlike the pure NFT model requested. Missing features include the collection limit and sequential minting constraints. The implementation uses data maps for balance and supply tracking, appropriate for semi-fungible tokens but not for NFTs. Error handling focuses on ownership and balance checks but omits collection limits. The mint function enables owner-only issuance but lacks token ID counters required for sequential NFTs. The absence of a 'get-last-token-id' function further highlights divergence from SIP-009 requirements, while the code's hybrid ownership tagging aligns with SIP-013. Thus, the code effectively implements SIP-013 but doesn't fulfill the original NFT-based request.","(impl-trait 'SPDBEG5X8XD50SPM1JJH0E5CTXGDV5NJTKAKKR5V.sip013-semi-fungible-token-trait.sip013-semi-fungible-token-trait)

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for a bridged stablecoin on the Stacks blockchain adhering to the SIP-10 standard with extended bridging capabilities. Include governance features like owner permissions, minting limits, token pausing, and address restrictions. The token must support customizable metadata (name, symbol, URI), precise decimal precision, and secure core operations (transfer, mint, burn) with validation and error management. Add an extension mechanism enabling approved contracts to interact via a restricted API. Ensure all actions trigger audit events and return explicit error codes. The token should initially be paused until unlocked by the owner, and all critical functions must validate caller privileges before proceeding.","Initially, the contract integrates several traits to define its operational interfaces, starting with the SIP-10 standard for token interoperability. Bridging and extension traits are added to enable cross-chain interactions and future upgrades. Error codes are predefined with unique identifiers starting at u10000 to streamline debugging and maintain code clarity. State variables store metadata, balances (using fungible-token), minter allowances, and banned addresses for efficient state tracking. Security measures enforce owner-only access for high-risk functions, with the token starting in a paused state to prevent premature use. Minting uses dual allowance/usage tracking to prevent over-issuance. SIP-10 functions provide standardized access to token data, while internal transfer logic enforces bans and pausing. Administrative functions uniformly check permissions, execute changes, log events, and return status codes. The extension system allows whitelisted contracts to execute controlled operations via run-extension! with authorization checks. Comprehensive input validation and error handling ensure state consistency. Transfer operations include optional memo fields for compliance logging, emitted in events alongside transaction details.",";; title: circle-usdce-token

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for the Stacks blockchain that acts as a simple banking system or digital piggy bank. Users should be able to deposit and withdraw STX tokens, with balances stored in an account map. The contract must include secure deposit handling, multiple withdrawal methods demonstrating different security levels (including one intentionally insecure to teach risks), and allow administrators to access any account. Implement a time-restricted withdrawal feature that only works after a specified block height. Add clear documentation on security measures, input checks, error handling with constants, and use Clarity-specific safety tools like assertions and conditional guards.","The solution begins by outlining all user requirements: tracking STX balances via a data map, secure deposit/withdrawal logic with varying implementations, administrator privileges, time-based restrictions, and educational security explanations. The contract first defines error codes for clarity and consistency, fulfilling the error-handling directive. A 'user-accounts' map is set to store balances, directly addressing the balance-tracking requirement. Deposit functionality safely transfers STX while noting edge cases for atomicity. Three withdrawal approaches are created: an unsafe version omitting balance checks to illustrate risks, a standard method using assertions for validation, and a modular version using helper functions. A privileged 'admin-withdraw' accesses any account after verifying authentication. The time-based feature uses block-height checks against a predefined value to unlock funds. Read-access functions like 'check-balance' ensure transparency without altering state. Comments throughout explain dangers of unchecked inputs, the importance of atomic transfers, and security best practices in Clarity, such as using 'asserts' and 'cond' guards. Each function's design emphasizes contrasting safe vs. unsafe patterns to highlight development pitfalls.",";; bank

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for a fundraising initiative on the Stacks blockchain that accepts contributions in STX and sBTC tokens. The contract must include initialization parameters for a funding target and campaign timeline, with a default duration of 30 days (measured in Bitcoin blocks). It should record donations per donor address, permit the campaign manager to terminate the initiative, allow donors to seek refunds upon cancellation, and authorize the beneficiary to claim funds after the campaign concludes. Include error handling mechanisms, read-only functions to monitor campaign progress and contribution details, and strict permissions to ensure secure access. Maintain records of total funds raised, campaign status, and individual donation values.","Initially, the goal is to develop a fundraising contract for Stacks blockchain, requiring secure state tracking and transaction handling. The contract must store key information like initialization status, beneficiary identity, timeline details (duration and start), financial goals, and contribution data. This data is managed via variables and maps (for STX/sBTC donations indexed by contributor addresses). Defining error constants with clear codes (e.g., 'unauthorized-action' or 'campaign-expired') enhances readability and error reporting. The initialization method enforces authorization by the deployer, verifies unstarted campaigns, and sets parameters with a default 30-day timeframe (converted into BTC block numbers). Cancellation logic ensures only authorized users can halt active campaigns before funds are disbursed. Contribution methods for STX and sBTC confirm campaign activity, update balances, and log donations. Withdrawal can only occur after the deadline, via beneficiary authorization, transferring both token types securely. Refunds are processed only if canceled, returning saved donations while removing records. Read-only functions enable visibility into campaign status, individual contributions, and overall metrics. The structure ensures all requirements are fulfilled with robust security and state integrity.",";; Fundraising Campaign Contract

"Develop a Clarity-based smart contract for the Stacks Blockchain that enables a payment streaming system. The contract must permit users to establish sBTC payment streams that distribute funds incrementally from sender to recipient over a defined block count. Include features for initiating streams, adding funds to existing streams, allowing recipients to claim accrued payments, enabling senders to reclaim unused funds post-stream completion, and permitting parameter adjustments with mutual approval confirmed via cryptographic signatures. Maintain a data structure tracking stream details like sender, recipient, remaining balance, withdrawn amount, payment speed, and time parameters. Incorporate safeguards against unauthorized actions, signature mismatches, active stream interference, and invalid stream references. Also, include utility functions to compute available funds and block intervals.","First, I must grasp the contract's objective: creating a Stacks Blockchain payment streaming system using Clarity. The core idea involves transferring sBTC gradually over a block-defined timeframe instead of a single transfer. For state management, a mapping structure will track each stream's details using unique identifiers, managed by an incrementing ID counter. The 'create-stream' function will initialize parameters, lock sender funds, and return the stream ID, ensuring the sender is the transaction initiator. A 'refuel' function lets senders add funds to existing streams, validated against their identity. To track streamed amounts, helper functions calculate elapsed blocks and derived balances using payment rates and time boundaries. Recipients withdraw earnings via a 'withdraw' function verified against their address, while 'refund' allows senders to reclaim residual funds post-stream end. Stream parameter updates require both parties' cryptographic approval, enforced through signature validation of proposed changes. Error handling includes restrictions for unauthorized access, invalid signatures, active streams, and non-existent IDs. Read-only functions like 'balance-of' optimize gas costs by avoiding state changes. Token transfers use the sBTC contract interface, with the main contract acting as intermediary to ensure secure fund management throughout the stream lifecycle.",";; payment-stream.clar

Add error codes and documentation.","I begin by analyzing the requirement to build a STX time-lock contract with specific access controls. FirstStep: Defining contract structure and ownership logic using tx-sender as deployer. Next: Establishing error codes for all stated conditions: invalid owner actions, existing locks, past unlock heights, zero deposits, non-beneficiary operations, and premature claims. Variables: An optional principal for beneficiary allows null up front, while unlocking block is stored as numeric value. LockFn implements ownership checks, future block validation (time_cmp?), zero-check on deposits, and transfers STX to contract. BestowFn: Validates current beneficiary as sender before transferring entitlement. ClaimFn uses time comparison to confirm post-unlock, then transfers full balance to beneficiary using contract's own execution context. EdgeCases: unwrap-panic ensures beneficiary exists before transfer; as-contract correct STX transfer permissions.

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for a fungible token on the Stacks blockchain named 'Clarity Coin' with the symbol 'CC', adhering to the SIP-010 standard. The token must have no set maximum supply and restrict minting privileges exclusively to the contract owner. The contract should include transfer functionality with sender authorization checks and an optional memo parameter, along with all required read-only methods (get-name, get-symbol, get-decimals, get-balance, get-total-supply, get-token-uri). Also include error codes for unauthorized minting and invalid transfers.","First, adopt the SIP-010 fungible token trait by referencing the standard contract at 'SP3FBR2AGK5H9QBDH3EEN6DF8EK8JY7RX8QJ5SVTE.sip-010-trait-ft-standard.sip-010-trait'. This enforces the required token interface. Ownership is set by defining the deployer address as contract-owner. Error codes 'err-owner-only' (u100) and 'err-invalid-transfer' (u101) are established to handle access violations. The 'clarity-coin' token is created without a supply cap via the fungible-token! form. The transfer function validates the transaction sender matches the declared sender, executes the transfer using ft-transfer?, and processes memo via optional buffer handling. Read-only functions return static values for name/symbol, decimals (u0), and delegate balances/supply queries to standard functions. The mint function checks tx-sender against contract-owner before using ft-mint? to issue tokens.

Implement access controls to restrict minting to the contract owner and transfers to token owners, with Clarity best practices including clear constants, data variables, and function separation.","First, I must determine the requirements: building an NFT contract on Stacks that meets the nft-trait standard, tracks tokens as 'stacksies', and includes necessary operations with robust error handling. The solution requires defining the contract interface, setting owner permissions, enabling sequential token minting, and offering query functions for metadata and ownership. The contract begins by importing the standard NFT interface to ensure compliance. Constants for the owner and errors are established upfront. Token IDs are managed via a data variable incremented during minting. Read accessors like get-last-token-id and get-owner provide state visibility. Transfer functionality enforces sender verification using asserts!, while minting restricts execution to the owner. The implementation avoids redundancy, uses error-returning functions for safety, and separates public (mint/transfer) from query functions as best practices dictate.","(impl-trait 'SP2PABAF9FTAJYNFZH93XENAJ8FVY99RRM50D2JG9.nft-trait.nft-trait)

"Develop a Clarity smart contract on the Stacks blockchain that fetches real-time price information for an asset, like BTC/USD, via the Stacks-Pyth Bridge. Ensure the contract includes deployment and testing guidance.","First, I'll determine the essential steps to integrate the Pyth Network with Stacks using the Bridge. Key constants for the Pyth Oracle and storage contract addresses, alongside the BTC/USD feed identifier in hex, must be defined using define-constant to ensure security and immutability. The primary function will invoke the Pyth Oracle contractâ€™s get-price function by passing the feed ID and storage address, potentially using as-contract to adjust context appropriately. Error management will rely on try! and unwrap! to handle errors from invalid feeds or outdated data. Deciding between a public or read-only function depends on whether Oracle calls require state changes. For clarity, define-public is likely optimal. The contract must incorporate the pyth-storage-trait for compatibility, while leveraging the pyth-decoder-trait to parse responses. Comprehensive inline documentation will explain each componentâ€™s role, including governance checks via pyth-governance-v2 and error propagation logic. Deployment steps will outline compiling the contract with clchi, deploying using Clarinet CLI, and testing with simulated blocks or mock price feeds to validate accuracy under various conditions. Testing with Clarinet helps verify real-time updates and error handling scenarios efficiently.",";; Pyth Oracle integration for BTC/USD price feed

"Develop a basic Clarity smart contract for a token named 'MyToken' (symbol: MTK) with an 8-decimal precision system. Initiate with a total supply of 21,000,000,000 tokens where 200 tokens are assigned to address ST398K1WZTBVY6FE2YEHM6HP20VSNVSSPJTW0D53M and 100 tokens to ST1JDEC841ZDWN9CKXKJMDQGP5TW1AM10B7EV0DV9. Ensure functionality for transferring tokens, allowing others to spend holdings, querying balances, and retrieving the total supply. Include options to cancel spending approvals and embed this metadata URI: ipfs://QmXwNHQ1BmE2hLRykAMMxjsmdeDGFSFg63KDMBUhtcMcKc.","The goal requires a fungible token contract in Clarity for 'MyToken.' First, the contract must define a fungible token with a total supply tracked via a data variable. Allowances between owners and approved addresses need a storage map to manage permissions. Approve and revoke functions will adjust these allowances, ensuring revoke resets permission. The transfer function must validate sender balances, while transfer-from checks both sender allowances and adjusts them post-transfer. Initial token allocation requires a minting function during contract deployment to distribute to specified addresses. Metadata such as name, symbol, decimals, and the provided IPFS URI should be accessible via getter functions. Error handling must enforce valid amounts and sufficient balances. The contract will use private helpers for allowance adjustments and public interfaces for user interaction, ensuring security and clarity. Architecture focuses on data privacy, modular functions, and enforceable constraints for safe token operations.","

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for a Stacks blockchain multisig wallet that supports owner administration (addition/removal with threshold validation), transaction submission/approval/cancellation, and cross-chain asset transfers via a bridge interface. Incorporate SIP-009/NFT and SIP-010/FT standards for asset handling, enforce permission controls through authorized caller lists, verify transaction approvals against ownership thresholds, and handle errors for conflicts, invalid inputs, and unauthorized operations. Organize the code with descriptive comments, data structures for tracking transactions/owners, and utility functions for state modifications, ensuring all critical functions include sender authentication and parameter integrity checks.","The contract constructs a multi-signature wallet (Multisafe) using Clarity on Stacks. First, it imports required interfaces defining execution rules, safe behavior, and token standards for NFTs/FTs, plus cross-chain bridge capabilities. By implementing the safe-trait interface, the contract establishes its role as a secure wallet. Error codes are defined to address authorization failures, transaction states, and other issues. The contract's principal (SELF) is used to enable self-referential operations. Core state variables include an owner list (capped at 20), approval threshold, and transaction counter. Owner management functions include strict validation to ensure threshold validity. Transactions follow a lifecycle: submission, confirmation, and execution, tracked via a detailed map. Security measures verify callers are contract owners or the contract itself. Cross-chain functionality integrates a bridge for escrow-based swaps. Initialization sets up initial owners and a 2-of-3 approval threshold. The design balances flexibility and security with a structured workflow for multi-party approvals and cross-chain interoperability.",";;title: safe-clar

"Design a Clarity smart contract for the Stacks blockchain that acts as a price oracle for BTC/USD rates, utilizing the Pyth Networkâ€™s pyth-storage-v3 contract. The contract must retrieve both current and historical prices using a specified feed ID, incorporate error handling with distinct codes, and support historical queries via block hashes or at-block parameters. It should interface with the sbtc-token contract to obtain sBTC total supply, normalize price and supply values (adjusted for 10^8 precision), and calculate the total sBTC value in USD. Ensure robust error management for external call failures, invalid inputs, and arithmetic overflows, while organizing the contract with read-only functions, strict type validation, and clear dependencies on external contracts.","The contractâ€™s primary goal is to securely access Pyth Network price data and perform calculations with error resilience. The error-handling mechanism begins by assigning unique codes like `ERR_UNEXPECTED` (e.g., 5000) to systematically address unforeseen issues. To fetch live BTC prices, the `get-btc-price` function uses `contract-call?` to interact with Pyth, returning a wrapped value on success or `none` on failure. Historical price queries involve `get-btc-price-at`, which first retrieves a valid block hash via `get-stacks-block-info?`, then executes the price lookup at that block using `at-block`, maintaining consistent error handling. Integration with the sbtc-token contract occurs through `contract-call?`, safely obtaining sBTC supply. The `get-sbtc-total-usd-value` function combines normalized supply (divided by 10^8) with adjusted price data, multiplying them to compute USD value, while `unwrap!` ensures early termination on failed calls. The contractâ€™s structure emphasizes read-only operations for safety, type-checked parameters to prevent overflow or invalid data, and modular design for maintainability, with all external dependencies explicitly declared.","(define-constant ERR_UNEXPECTED (err u5000))

"Develop a Clarity smart contract to manage a counter with the following features: establish constants for specific error identifiers, maintain state variables for count, contract owner, and operation cost, provide read-only access to the current count and historical count at a given block, and include public methods to adjust the counter (increment, decrement, add) while enforcing rules like non-negative counts, restricting additions beyond one unit, and collecting STX payments according to the cost variable.","First, constants for error codes must be declared to standardize error handling, such as ERR_COUNT_MUST_BE_POSITIVE for invalid decrements and ERR_ADD_MORE_THAN_ONE to block excessive increments. Additionally, ERR_BLOCK_NOT_FOUND addresses failed block history queries. These constants improve code clarity and consistency. Next, state variables are initialized: count (starting at zero), contract-owner (set to the deploying address), and cost (fixed at 10 STX). Public functions like increment require STX transfers via stx-transfer? before updating the count, while decrement includes a check using asserts! to prevent negative values. The add function enforces that the input exceeds one and calculates total fees (n * cost). Read-only functions use var-get for current count and at-block with block header lookups for historical data, returning errors if blocks are missing. All operations return ok upon success to confirm execution, ensuring users receive clear responses. This structure integrates payment validation, state management, and error constraints to fulfill the requirements securely.",";;title: counter

"I require a Clarity-based smart contract that validates Bitcoin transactions by cross-referencing transaction details with a merkle proof and the corresponding block header. The contract must also process witness data for SegWit transactions, implement robust error handling for potential failures, and enforce strict constraints on data lengths throughout its execution.","To begin, I must clarify the contract's requirements: it must verify Bitcoin transactions using Clarity by validating merkle proofs against block headers, support SegWit witness data, and include error handling for anomalies. This requires expertise in Bitcoin's transaction structure and Clarity's limitations. First, define error codes for scenarios like invalid proofs, buffer overflows, or malformed data to enhance code clarity. Next, develop helper functions to parse Bitcoin's variable-length formats, such as varints and byte arrays, ensuring proper handling of endianness conversions. Transaction parsing functions will decode version, inputs, outputs, and locktime, while SegWit-specific logic will process witness commitments. Block header parsing extracts essential fields for merkle root verification. Merkle proof validation involves reconstructing the root from provided hashes and comparing it to the header's root. SegWit validation requires checking the witness commitment in transaction outputs. The contract must enforce data size limits via Clarity's buffer constraints to prevent overflow. Finally, design user-facing functions to encapsulate verification steps, ensuring deterministic execution and error propagation through Clarity's strict operational limits.",";; title: stateless contract to verify bitcoin transaction

"Design a Clarity smart contract for an NFT collection that includes functionality such as defining a non-fungible token, managing token identifiers, handling ownership records, and enabling minting and transferring tokens. The contract should include error codes for scenarios like unauthorized actions or invalid transactions, incorporate a base URI for token metadata, and validate Bitcoin transaction confirmation via an external clarity-bitcoin-lib-v5 library. The minting process must increment the token ID, confirm the sender is the contract owner, verify the Bitcoin transaction was successfully mined, and assign the token to the recipient. The transfer process must restrict initiation to the token owner and update ownership accurately.","First, I'll determine the requirements. The task involves constructing an NFT contract with specific features like ownership, minting, and Bitcoin validation integration. To ensure standard compliance, implementing an NFT interface through a recognized trait in Clarity is necessary. Error handling is crucial for cases such as unauthorized minting attempts or rejected Bitcoin transactions. State variables like the next token ID, ownership records, and a base URI for metadata must be declared. The mint function's logic requires incrementing the token ID, checking sender authority, validating Bitcoin transaction confirmation via the external library, and minting the token. The transfer function needs strict ownership verification before allowing transfers. The Bitcoin tx validation step will rely on the specified library's functionality. Functions should return appropriate success or error statuses, with error constants covering unauthorized access, invalid IDs, or failed tx validations.",";;title: btc-tx-enabled-nft

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for a fungible token compliant with the SIP-010 standard, ensuring inclusion of all required functions and constants. The contract must implement the SIP-010 trait, establish a token named 'count-token', define error constants for unauthorized owner actions and non-owners, set the contract owner as the transaction deployer, introduce a mutable TOKEN-URI variable initialized with a default value, and declare constants for the token's name, symbol, and decimal places. Include read-only methods to fetch balances, total supply, metadata, and URI, along with public functions to update the URI (owner-only), mint fixed amounts to the sender via a .counter contract, burn tokens or STX if insufficient balance, and transfer tokens between accounts with an optional memo while enforcing ownership validation.","To create this SIP-010-compliant fungible token contract, I first confirm the SIP-010 trait implementation, which aligns with Stacks' fungible token standard. The 'define-fungible-token' directive will establish the 'count-token' type. Error constants like ERR_OWNER_ONLY (u100) and ERR_NOT_TOKEN_OWNER (u101) are designated to handle permission issues. The contract owner is set to tx-sender at deployment. A mutable TOKEN-URI variable, initialized with a placeholder string, allows future updates. Constants for name, symbol, and decimals (e.g., 'Count Token', 'COUNT', and a specified decimal value) define core metadata. Read-only functions are implemented to expose balance, total supply, and metadata. Public functions include set-token-uri (owner-restricted), a mint function restricted to the .counter contract, a burn function with STX fallback, and a transfer function verifying sender authority, managing memos, and adhering to SIP-010 transfer logic. Permission checks ensure only authorized parties can execute critical operations, with URI updates and minting tied to specific conditions.",";;title:count-token

"I require a Clarity smart contract that enables an off-chain payment channel system for STX and SIP-010 tokens, incorporating features such as channel creation, termination, dispute resolution, signature validation, nonce tracking, and payment distribution, while prioritizing security and performance standards in the Stacks blockchain environment.","First, I must analyze how payment channels function within the Stacks ecosystem and their operational flow. These channels enable low-cost, off-chain exchanges between users, reducing on-chain activity and costs. Key steps include establishing a channel with initial deposits, managing multiple transactions via signed updates, and finalizing balances on-chain. The contract must address core operations like channel initialization, state updates, dispute mechanisms, and secure closure. Security is critical, requiring rigorous signature validation to authenticate transactions. For state tracking, the contract needs to store participant details, balance allocations, expiration timers, and nonces to thwart replay attacks. Supporting both native STX and SIP-010 tokens demands a flexible design using traits. Channel identification should use a standardized key derived from participant addresses to ensure uniqueness. Signature protocols aligned with SIP-018 will prevent misuse across different contracts. The lifecycle functions must include cooperative and unilateral closure options, dispute resolution with timelocks, and escrow management for safe fund distribution. Edge cases like inactive participants or invalid state transitions require safeguards like forced timeouts and strict validation checks. Nonce increments, HTLC support for conditional payments, and event logging for monitoring are also essential. The contract must validate balance consistency during updates and implement clear error handling to enhance reliability and user clarity.",";; title: stackflow

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for a subnet infrastructure that supports miner management, registration of both fungible and non-fungible token contracts, block commitment with withdrawal roots, STX and token deposit/withdrawal processing, Merkle proof validation for verification, and secure asset transfers or minting, following the example structure provided.","To begin, I'll review subnet mechanics in blockchain systemsâ€”subnets allow decentralized processing separate from the main network. The contract must enable cross-chain coordination between mainnet and subnet. First, define error identifiers for block submissions, invalid participants, asset validation failures, and transfers to enhance error management. Design state-tracking structures like block records, withdrawal root storage, and withdrawal tracking maps. An authorized miner account will secure block proposal rights.
Contract interaction with external tokens requires defining standardized interfaces for fungible/non-fungible assets and a minting rule for subnet-originated assets. Miner replacement must be permissioned solely to existing miners. Asset contract registration (via the miner) maps L1-L2 contract relationships.
Block commits must include fresh withdrawal roots and chronological checks. For assets, STX and tokens require deposit logic (transfers to this contract) and withdrawal fulfillment after Merkle proof verification. NFT withdrawals may require minting if the token isnâ€™t locally held. Fungible token balances need careful management to handle mint/burn logic during withdrawals.
Merkle validation functions must hash STX/fungible/non-fungible leaf nodes uniquely, then validate proof paths against stored roots. Each withdrawalâ€™s leaf must be claimed exactly once with processing tracking. Implement strict preconditions in all functions to block invalid operations and double-spends. Emit events for traceability during critical operations to enable off-chain tracking.",";;title: subnet

"Design a Clarity smart contract for an NFT called 'funny-dog' that adheres to the nft-trait interface, uses a uint type as its unique token identifier, and incorporates minting, ownership transfer, and metadata retrieval functions. The contract must restrict unapproved actions, stop minting exceeding a set maximum, and utilize a base URI for metadata. Include safeguards against unauthorized operations, invalid transfers, and over the collection capacity.","To develop the Funny-Dog NFT contract, begin by adopting the nft-trait interface to ensure compatibility with ecosystem standards. Define the NFT with a 'define-non-fungible-token' command specifying uint identifiers. Track the next available token ID via a counter initialized at zero. Establish ownership by capturing the contract deployer's address as the owner. Declare error codes for unauthorized access, transfer errors, and cap breaches. Store a mutable base URI for metadata. Create read-functions to retrieve token metadata (URI, owner) using built-in lookups. Implement a transfer method verifying sender ownership before execution. Craft a minting function checking ownership, remaining capacity, executing minting, and updating the counter. Enforce the fixed collection size using a constant. Though placeholder token IDs could be dynamically appended to base URIs, the current setup meets core functional requirements. Each step ensures security controls and specification adherence.",";;title: funny dog

"Create a Clarity smart contract for an NFT marketplace enabling users to list, cancel, and purchase NFTs with STX or fungible tokens. Include mechanisms to handle expired listings, unauthorized access, and mismatched assets. Ensure asset contracts are whitelisted, validate listing details rigorously, and implement secure NFT/Fungible Token transfers. Structure the contract for robustness and efficiency without deployment elements.","Initially, identify core marketplace features: listing creation, cancellation, and fulfillment options. Implement STX and Fungible Token payment methods by creating separate transaction pathways. Establish traits for NFT and Fungible Token interactions. Use a structured data map to store listings with seller details, asset references, expiration, price, and payment type. Introduce a whitelist for secured asset contracts and a nonce system to generate unique listing IDs. Develop error handlers for invalid assets, unauthorized actions, and expired listings. Create helper functions for transferring assets and validating transactions. Ensure only authorized parties can modify listings and whitelist configurations. Secure transfers via escrow-like mechanisms to ensure atomic operations. Include checks to authenticate ownership, validate payment accuracy, and confirm payment method alignment with listings. Optimize functions for read-only access to minimize costs.",";;title: nft-marketplace

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for a decentralized marketplace named 'tiny-market' to enable users to create, revoke, and execute NFT trading offers. The contract must handle whitelisting asset contracts, track listing details (seller, buyer, token ID, expiry time, cost), enforce validity rules such as expiry checks, cost accuracy, and payment type restrictions. It must process transactions using STX or fungible tokens (FTs), validate correct permissions for actions like revoking offers, ensure matching asset and payment contracts, utilize traits for NFT and FT compliance, include error handling for issues like access violations or expired offers, and provide utility functions to ensure safe asset transfers.","First, it is essential to establish a smart contract framework that supports NFT trade creation, cancellation, and fulfillment within a decentralized marketplace. The design requires security features for STX/FT transactions, including validation mechanisms and permissions management. Initial steps involve declaring NFT and FT traits via use-trait to interact with standardized protocols, while restricting administrative controls to the contract owner for contract whitelisting decisions. A listings registry is created using a mapping, indexed by unique IDs generated through a nonce counter. Only whitelisted asset and payment contracts are permitted in transactions to mitigate risks. Helper methods for NFT/FT transfers are defined first to handle inter-contract operations safely. Listing submissions are validated by checking contract whitelisting, valid expirations, and non-zero prices before escrowing assets. Cancellation logic requires confirming the user's ownership and returning assets upon success. A separate validation utility centralizes checks for fulfilling offers (e.g., proper buyers, expiry status). Fulfillment pathways for STX-based and FT-based payments divide transaction handling, ensuring funds are transferred only after executing required validations and state updates. Security measures like atomic operations via try! blocks ensure all steps complete fully or roll back entirely, protecting assets from partial transfers. This structure balances functionality with rigorous security constraints to deliver a secure, cross-contract compatible marketplace system.",";; title:tiny-market
