"Rephrase the original request for a Clarity smart contract on the Stacks blockchain that handles decentralized lending. The contract should let users deposit and earn yield on STX, as well as borrow STX against their deposits, up to a certain limit. Detail the required functionality, including interest accrual, error handling, and information retrieval.","Summarize the thought process for creating the Clarity smart contract. This includes outlining requirements like managing STX deposits, calculating loan amounts based on collateral and a set loan-to-value ratio, handling loan repayments and yield distribution, accruing interest dynamically, incorporating error handling, and providing read-only functions for data transparency and identified errors during the analysis of the borrow and other functions.

"Develop a Stacks blockchain Clarity smart contract for a basic NFT marketplace. This marketplace should enable users to offer NFTs for sale, specifying details such as the NFT's ID, a sale expiration time, the asking price, the accepted payment method (either STX or SIP010 tokens), and an optional specific buyer. The contract must support features for adding approved contracts to a whitelist, adding new NFT listings, removing existing listings, and completing sales using both STX and alternative fungible tokens. Ensure the contract includes appropriate error handling, security measures, and utilizes the standard NFT and fungible token traits to maintain compatibility.","The task is to build an NFT marketplace smart contract on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity. Key requirements include configurable listing parameters (token ID, expiry, price, payment type, optional intended buyer), contract whitelisting, asset listing/delisting/purchase handling (STX and fungible tokens), security, and error handling. Clarity's properties (decidability, no reentrancy) are beneficial for secure asset management. The design revolves around a map for storing listings, keyed by unique integer IDs, with each entry storing all listing details. A nonce is used to generate unique listing IDs. A whitelist, managed by the contract owner, restricts interactions to approved contracts. Comprehensive error codes enhance debugging. The `list-asset` function validates input, transfers the NFT to the contract, and stores the listing. `get-listing` retrieves listing details. `cancel-listing` allows only the maker to cancel, returning the NFT. Purchase fulfillment is split into STX and fungible token functions, both validating conditions (buyer, taker, expiry, asset contracts) via `assert-can-fulfil`, ensuring a secure trade. Helper functions (`transfer-nft`, `transfer-ft`) handle token transfers, promoting maintainability. The `as-contract` context strengthens security by acting on the contract's behalf. STX payments use `stx-transfer?`; fungible tokens utilize `transfer-ft`. Listings are verified first, then transfer the assets, payment is finalized, and finally remove listing. No marketplace commission is included for minimality. Edge cases (expired listings, unauthorized cancellations) are handled. The contract efficiently meets all requirements with a secure, well-structured design, adhering to good software development practices.",";; A tiny NFT marketplace that allows users to list NFT for sale. They can specify the following:
;; - The NFT token to sell.
;; - Listing expiry in block height.
;; - The payment asset, either STX or a SIP010 fungible token.
;; - The NFT price in said payment asset.
;; - An optional intended taker. If set, only that principal will be able to fulfil the listing.

"Develop a Stacks Blockchain smart contract in Clarity that adheres to the SIP-009 standard for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This contract should define an NFT called ""Your-NFT-Name"" with a maximum supply of 1000. It should track the ID of the most recently minted token.  The contract should include: an owner (initialized to the deployer), error codes for failed ownership checks and exceeding the supply limit, and a configurable base URI for metadata. Implement all SIP-009 functions (get-last-token-id, get-token-uri, get-owner, transfer), and a mint function restricted to the contract owner. The mint function must enforce the supply cap, assign the token to a designated recipient, increment the token ID, and return the ID of the newly minted token.

Create a Clarity smart contract adhering to the SIP-009 NFT standard by implementing the required trait. This ensures interoperability.
2.  Define the NFT, ""Your-NFT-Name"", using unsigned integers for token IDs.
3.  Implement a counter (data variable initialized to zero) to track the last minted token ID, ensuring uniqueness.
4.  Define constants: contract owner (tx-sender), collection limit (1000), and error codes for unauthorized access and exceeding the limit.
5.  Create a base URI variable for token metadata, allowing individual token metadata through a token ID placeholder.
6.  Implement SIP-009 functions:
    -   `get-last-token-id`: Returns the current token ID counter.
    -   `get-token-uri`: Returns the metadata URI for a given token ID.
    -   `get-owner`: Retrieves the owner of a specific token.
    -   `transfer`: Transfers a token, verifying the sender's ownership.
7.  Implement the `transfer` function with sender verification, ensuring only the owner can transfer a token.
8.  Implement the `mint` function with the following checks and actions:
    -   Increment the last token ID.
    -   Verify the collection limit hasn't been reached.
    -   Restrict access to the contract owner.
    -   Mint the token to the specified recipient.
    -   Update the last token ID.

It creates a semi-fungible token named 'semi-fungible-token' and an NFT for ID management called 'semi-fungible-token-id', using composite keys. This allows tracking both the specific ID and quantity owned, unlike the pure NFT requested. Crucially, the 1000-token limit is absent; the code provides a general implementation without quantity or specific number of IDs restrictions. Storage uses data maps for balances/supplies, typical for semi-fungible tokens where users can own multiple of the same ID. Error handling is present for ownership ('err-owner-only') and balance ('err-insufficient-balance'), but not for collection size. Sender verification in the transfer function is handled correctly. All SIP-013 functions are implemented, including balance queries, supply, transfers (single and batch, even batch transfers which are not mentioned in question), and a owner restricted minting function. The code includes a utility function 'tag-nft-token-id' for a non-fungible token tagging strategy. The most substantial mismatch is the absence of 'get-last-token-id', essential for sequential NFT minting but irrelevant for semi-fungible tokens. In summary, the code implements SIP-013 correctly but does *not* fulfill the question's SIP-009 NFT requirements.","(impl-trait 'SPDBEG5X8XD50SPM1JJH0E5CTXGDV5NJTKAKKR5V.sip013-semi-fungible-token-trait.sip013-semi-fungible-token-trait)

"How can we design a Clarity smart contract for a Stacks blockchain-based stablecoin that supports bridging, adheres to the SIP-10 standard, and includes features like administrative control, minting/burning, pausing, address banning, and an extension system for interaction with authorized contracts? The token should handle decimals precisely, have configurable metadata, emit events for all operations, and start in a paused state.","The contract begins by defining multiple traits, including SIP-10 for standard token functionality, and others for bridging and extensibility.  Error codes, starting at u10000, are defined as constants for consistent error handling. State is managed using data variables and maps. Token metadata is stored as string variables.  Token balances are managed with the `fungible-token` type. Maps track minter allowances and bans, and data-var to manage pausing. Security centers around an ownership model; sensitive operations necessitate the caller to be the owner. The token starts paused, requiring owner activation. Minting uses a dual-map system (allowance and usage tracking). Standard SIP-10 functions are implemented. Administrative functions consistently verify authorization, perform the task, emit an event, and indicate success. Address banning prevents transfers to/from banned addresses. An extension system grants authorized contracts controlled access via `as-contract`. Thorough error handling is present in all functions via validations, `unwrap!`, and match expressions, and token supports memo field for compliance and tracking.",";; title: circle-usdce-token

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for the Stacks blockchain that simulates a basic bank or piggy bank.  Users should be able to deposit and withdraw STX tokens. The contract must track user balances, offer secure deposit functionality, and showcase several withdrawal methods, each demonstrating different security approaches (including a deliberately insecure one for learning purposes).  It needs a read-only function for checking balances, administrative controls enabling a designated bank owner to withdraw from any account, and a time-locked withdrawal feature that activates after a specified block height. The contract should be well-commented, explaining security aspects, input validation methods, and proper error handling using constants. The contract must show use of Clarity's security features such as assertions, and if statements.","The solution will involve creating a Clarity smart contract that fulfills all listed banking features. First, it is necessary to define error constants for the contract to enable consistent error handling. A data map named ""accounts"" will store user balances, associating principals with their STX token balances. The `deposit` function will manage STX deposits, incrementing user balances accordingly. Multiple withdrawal functions will be implemented, demonstrating different security levels. One should be intentionally unsafe to expose vulnerabilities. Others will utilize assertions and `if` conditional checks to show secure patterns. A `get-balance` read-only function will address retrieving the user balance. Administrative functions allowing a bank owner to withdraw from user accounts will be included, as well as and a time-locked withdrawal function.  Detailed comments will explain security considerations, input validation, and error handling techniques, showing effective use of Clarity's built-in features that enhance contract security.",";; bank

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for a Stacks blockchain-based fundraising campaign. This contract should accept donations in STX and sBTC.  It needs functions for setting a funding goal and duration (defaulting to ~30 days in Bitcoin blocks) during initialization, tracking donations per donor, allowing the owner to cancel the campaign, enabling donor refunds if canceled, and permitting the beneficiary to withdraw funds post-campaign. Include error handling, getter functions for checking status and donations, and authorization checks for all functions. The contract should track total donations, status, and individual contributions.","The goal is to create a Stacks fundraising contract. State management is crucial for donations, campaign status, and secure transactions. Core state variables include initialization status, cancellation flag, withdrawal status, beneficiary, duration, start time, goal, and donation tracking. Data variables maintain contract state. Individual donations are tracked via maps (one for STX, one for sBTC) using donor addresses as keys. Error constants enhance readability/maintainability, providing feedback on failures. Initialization requires ownership checks, prevents double-initialization, and sets parameters; a default duration is included. Campaign management includes cancellation/fund handling with authorization and initialization checks, preventing cancellation post-withdrawal.  Donation functions for STX and sBTC verify campaign status, check end time, transfer funds, update donor records, and increase totals. Withdrawal requires authorization, checks for active campaign and prior withdrawal, and verifies the end time before transferring STX and sBTC. Refunds work only after cancellation, returning funds and cleaning records. Read-only getter functions enable checking donations, metrics, and contract balance.

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for the Stacks Blockchain that enables payment streaming. This contract should facilitate the gradual transfer of sBTC from a sender to a receiver over a defined period (measured in blocks). It should support creating new streams, adding funds to existing ones, allowing recipients to withdraw earned funds, enabling senders to reclaim unstreamed funds after the stream's completion, and permitting mutually agreed-upon modifications to stream details, verified via cryptographic signatures.  The contract should store stream data, including sender, recipient, total deposit, amount withdrawn, rate of payment, and start/end blocks.  Incorporate error handling for unauthorized actions, incorrect signatures, actions on active/inactive streams, and invalid stream IDs. Provide helper functions for calculating available balances and the number of elapsed blocks.","The goal is to create a Stacks/Clarity smart contract for streaming sBTC payments. This means payments are transferred gradually over time (measured in blocks), not all at once. The contract needs mappings to store each stream's details (sender, receiver, amount, rate, start/end blocks, withdrawn amount) using unique stream IDs.  A stream ID counter will ensure unique IDs. The 'stream-to' function will create a new stream, transferring the initial sBTC deposit from the sender to the contract and setting the stream's parameters. 'Refuel' will allow the sender to add more sBTC to an existing stream. To calculate the streamed amount, helper functions 'calculate-block-delta' (determine elapsed blocks) and 'balance-of' (calculate available amounts for sender/receiver based on the rate and elapsed time) are needed. 'Withdraw' will allow the recipient to claim their accumulated sBTC.  'Refund' will allow the sender to reclaim any remaining sBTC *after* the stream's end block. An 'update-details' function, secured by cryptographic signatures from both parties ('hash-stream' and 'validate-signature' facilitate this), will allow modifications to the stream's terms.  Robust error handling is crucial, covering unauthorized access, bad signatures, actions on active/finished streams, and nonexistent stream IDs. Read-only functions (like 'balance-of') optimize gas usage.  sBTC token transfers will use the standard token interface ('contract-call?') and the 'as-contract' pattern to ensure the contract controls fund transfers.",";; payment-stream.clar

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for the Stacks blockchain named ""timelocked-wallet"". This contract should function as a time-locked wallet, enabling the contract owner to deposit STX tokens for a specified beneficiary, which can only be claimed after a predetermined block height. The contract must include: 1. A `lock` function for the owner to deposit tokens, set the beneficiary, and specify the future unlock block height. 2. A `bestow` function allowing the current beneficiary to transfer their beneficiary rights to another principal. 3. A `claim` function for the beneficiary to withdraw the tokens once the unlock block height has been reached. Implement comprehensive error handling to ensure only the owner can perform owner actions, prevent double-locking, enforce future unlock heights, validate deposit amounts, restrict beneficiary-specific actions, and prevent early withdrawals. Utilize data variables to store the beneficiary (initially unset) and the unlock height (initially zero). Include comments explaining its functionality.","The task is to create a Clarity smart contract for a time-locked wallet on Stacks. This involves understanding Clarity syntax and blockchain elements like principals, transfers, and block heights. The core requirements are a wallet that locks STX until a set block height, with `lock`, `bestow`, and `claim` functions. The owner locks tokens for a beneficiary, who can transfer rights or claim tokens post-unlock height. The contract should start with comments explaining its function. The contract deployer is set as the owner. Define error constants for clarity. Data variables track the beneficiary (optional principal, initially none) and unlock height (uint, initially zero). The `lock` function validates that the sender is the owner, no beneficiary exists (no double-locking), the unlock height is in the future, and the amount is positive. It transfers STX, sets beneficiary and unlock height, returning `ok`. `bestow` lets the current beneficiary transfer rights, updating the beneficiary after validating the sender. `claim` lets the beneficiary withdraw after the unlock height, validating the sender and height. The contract uses `stx-get-balance` for a full withdrawal and `unwrap-panic` for the beneficiary (safe due to prior assertion). Error constants provide informative messages. The contract addresses all requirements, prioritizing security, usability, and maintainability using Clarity's type system and following best practices.",";; timelocked-wallet

Define error constants for unauthorized minting and transfer attempts.","1. **Implement SIP-010 Trait:** Begin by implementing the SIP-010 trait to ensure the contract meets the fungible token standard interface.
2. **Establish Ownership and Error Codes:** Define a contract owner (the deployer) and error codes for unauthorized minting (`err-owner-only`) and invalid transfers (`err-not-token-owner`).
3. **Create the Token:** Define the fungible token 'clarity-coin' without a supply cap.
4. **Implement `transfer` Function:** Create a `transfer` function that takes amount, sender, recipient, and an optional memo. It must:
    - Verify that `tx-sender` is the same as the provided `sender`.
    - Perform the token transfer using `ft-transfer?`.
    - Handle the optional memo: print it if provided, or return a default value if not.

    - `get-name`: Return ""Clarity Coin"".
    - `get-symbol`: Return ""CC"".
    - `get-decimals`: Return `u0` (no decimals).
    - `get-balance`: Use `ft-get-balance` to get a principal's balance.
    - `get-total-supply`: Use `ft-get-supply` to get the total supply.
    - `get-token-uri`: Return `none` (no URI specified).
6. **Implement `mint` Function:** Create a `mint` function that takes an amount and recipient.  It should:
    - Check if the caller is the contract owner.
    - Mint the specified amount to the recipient using `ft-mint?`.

1.  **Trait Implementation:** The code begins by implementing the standard NFT trait, which is crucial for interoperability on Stacks.
2.  **Constants:**  It defines constants for the contract owner (set to the deployer) and error codes, enhancing readability and error handling.
3.  **NFT Definition:** It correctly defines the NFT collection named ""stacksies"" with `uint` token IDs and uses a `last-token-id` data variable to track the sequence.
4.  **Read-Only Functions:** It implements `get-last-token-id`, `get-token-uri` (currently a placeholder), and `get-owner`, fulfilling the query requirements.
5.  **Transfer Function:** The transfer function includes a vital check to ensure only the token owner can initiate a transfer, correctly using `asserts!` and built in `nft-transfer?` function.
6.  **Mint Function:**  The mint function restricts minting to the contract owner, increments the `last-token-id`, mints the token, and updates the ID. This permission check is essential.
7.  **Overall Assessment:** The response effectively implements all specified features, adhering to Clarity standards, incorporating error handling, separates core code into relevant functions, and distinguishes clearly between read-only and public functions.","(impl-trait 'SP2PABAF9FTAJYNFZH93XENAJ8FVY99RRM50D2JG9.nft-trait.nft-trait)

Develop a Stacks smart contract in Clarity that fetches the current BTC/USD price from the Pyth Network via the Stacks-Pyth Bridge. Provide instructions for deploying and testing the contract.,"The goal is to build a Clarity smart contract that gets the live BTC/USD price from Pyth Network using the Stacks-Pyth Bridge. This involves understanding the interaction between Pyth and Stacks, using traits like `pyth-storage-trait` and `pyth-decoder-trait`. First, define constants for contract addresses (Pyth Oracle, storage) and the BTC/USD feed ID (32-byte hex). The core function will use the Pyth Oracle's `get-price` method, passing the feed ID and storage contract address. Context switching with `as-contract` might be necessary for the storage contract. Proper error handling (e.g., `try!`, `unwrap!`) is crucial for issues like invalid addresses or stale data.  A `define-public` function is likely needed, given prior examples and potential state changes.  The function might need to manage errors internally or return a response type. The `pyth-storage-trait` will be integrated. Inline documentation will explain each step, including governance checks, `as-contract` usage, and response handling.  The code structure will be modular for easier testing (e.g., with Clarinet) and maintainability, covering governance, price retrieval, and error handling.",";; Pyth Oracle integration for BTC/USD price feed

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for a Stacks-based multi-signature wallet. This wallet should support adding and removing owners (subject to a confirmation threshold), submitting, confirming, revoking, and executing transactions. It should also facilitate cross-chain token swaps using an external ""magic bridge"" interface. The contract should integrate with SIP-009 (NFT) and SIP-010 (FT) traits for asset transfers. Access control must be enforced through a list of allowed callers, and transaction confirmations must be validated against the owner threshold. Ensure comprehensive error handling for situations like ownership disputes, incorrect input parameters, and unauthorized access attempts. The code should be well-documented with comments, use data maps to store transaction and owner information, and include helper functions for internal updates. Critical operations should be protected by checks for sender authorization and parameter validity.","The code represents a Clarity smart contract for a multi-signature wallet on the Stacks blockchain (Multisafe). The core function: a secure wallet needing multiple confirmations before transaction execution. It begins by importing traits defining behaviors of executors, safes, NFTs, fungible tokens, and a ""magic bridge"" for cross-chain actions. The implementation defines it as a safe, per the safe-trait. Error constants cover wide-ranging failures, including authorization and transaction states. A key feature: the utilization of 'SELF,' representing the contract's principal allowing the contract to perform actions. Key state variables are defined including a list of wallet owners(max 20), a confirmation threshold, and TX nonce (critical for multi-sig functionality). Owner management permits adding/removing with security validation. The confirmation threshold must always remain valid: >0 and <= total owners. TX management employs a flow: submission, confirmation, execution, stored in a map with details and confirmations where owners can submit, confirm, and revoke. Most functions confirm the caller's identity (contract itself or authorized owner) for security. Integration with a ""magic bridge"" enables cross-chain features, letting owners initialize swappers, and execute swaps. A critical detail: setup of initial owners/threshold (three principals, threshold of 2, requiring any 2 of 3 to confirm transactions). Contract achieves: secure, flexible multi-sig wallet with cross-chain capabilities.",";;title: safe-clar

"Create a Stacks blockchain Clarity smart contract that acts as a price oracle for BTC/USD. This oracle should fetch both current and past prices from the Pyth Network's pyth-storage-v3 contract using a specific price feed ID. The contract should include detailed error handling. It needs to support looking up historical prices using both at-block and block header hashes. Additionally, it should connect with the sbtc-token contract to get the total supply of sBTC, adjust values by dividing by 10^8 to maintain accuracy, and calculate the total sBTC value in USD. The contract should handle errors for situations like unsuccessful external calls, bad data, and arithmetic overflow. It should also be well-organized, using read-only functions where applicable, type-safe checks, and clearly defined relationships with other needed traits/contracts.","The contract is designed to get and process BTC/USD prices from the Pyth Network, focusing on being robust to errors and having a modular structure. The error handling uses `ERR_UNEXPECTED` (u5000) to manage unexpected errors consistently. The `get-btc-price` function retrieves the current BTC price by calling `pyth-storage-v3` with `contract-call?` and a specific price feed ID. It returns the price in `some` if successful, or `none` if it fails, to avoid execution issues. The `get-btc-price-at` function retrieves historical prices. It first gets the block hash with `get-stacks-block-info?` and uses `unwrap-panic` to verify it. Then, it calls the price retrieval at that specific block using `at-block`, handling errors like the real-time price function. The contract interacts with the `sbtc-token` contract. The `get-sbtc-total-supply` function gets the total sBTC supply safely using `contract-call?`. The `get-sbtc-total-usd-value` function combines everything: it gets the total sBTC supply, adjusts it by dividing by 10^8, does the same for the BTC price, and multiplies them to calculate the total value in USD. Using `unwrap!` ensures that failures are caught immediately. The contract is well-structured by having all functions as read-only, which keeps state safe and makes reusability better. It manages dependencies on external contracts and uses type safety. By organizing logic into modular and composable function calls, the contract is easy to maintain but at the same time, it is robust.","(define-constant ERR_UNEXPECTED (err u5000))

"Create a Clarity smart contract for managing a counter. This contract should include: constant definitions for error codes; storage for a count, an owner, and a cost; read-only functions for retrieving the count at the present and at a past block; and public functions for increasing, decreasing, and adding to the count, with checks for positive counts, addition limits, and correct STX payments based on the cost.","First, define error code constants for readability and maintainability, such as for a non-positive count, adding too much at once, and a failure to retrieve a specified block. Next, declare mutable state variables: 'count' initialized to zero, 'contract-owner' set to the transaction sender, and 'cost' set to 10 STX. Then, create read-only functions: one to get the current count and another to get the count at a specific block, using 'at-block' and 'get-stacks-block-info?'. Handle the case where the block isn't found. Subsequently, implement public functions. 'increment' increases the count by one, requiring an STX payment equal to the 'cost'. 'decrement' decreases it by one, ensuring the count remains non-negative. 'add' increases the count by a specified value, checking that this increment is greater than one and processing an STX transfer for the total cost (increment multiplied by cost). All public functions should return 'ok' upon success. The structure enforces the requirements through a combination of controlled state changes, error checks, and mandatory payments.",";;title: counter

"How can we create a Clarity smart contract to confirm Bitcoin transactions? This contract should validate transactions by comparing them against their Merkle proofs and the corresponding block header. It must also support SegWit transactions, include thorough error checks, and enforce strict limits on data lengths.","The contract's goal is to verify Bitcoin transactions within a Clarity smart contract. This involves checking transaction specifics against Merkle proofs and block headers and handling SegWit transactions with robust error management. It's a complex process requiring knowledge of Bitcoin transactions and Clarity's features.

We'll start by planning error codes for various failure scenarios, such as buffer overflows, size discrepancies, and incorrect proofs. Defining these error codes as constants will improve code clarity and maintainability, essential for handling potentially malformed transaction data.

Next, let's consider the functions for reading Bitcoin data. Due to Bitcoin's use of variable-length fields, helper functions will be needed to parse data. These will include basic readers for fixed-length integers (read-uint8, read-uint16, read-uint32, read-uint64), taking transaction buffer and index, and returning the value and the updated index.

A dedicated parser for variable-length integers (varints) is necessary because Bitcoin uses a prefix byte to indicate the length of the integer. For byte arrays (varslices) in Bitcoin, which start with a length varint, we also need parsers. Hash conversions (e.g., reverse-buff32) will be needed for little-endian to big-endian conversion.

Transaction parsing functions (parse-tx and parse-wtx for SegWit) will use the reader functions mentioned before, conforming to Bitcoin's serialization. These must check for accurate data consumption to prevent malicious transaction truncation. Block header parsing (parse-block-header) is needed to get fields for verifying transaction inclusion.

Merkle proof verification involves hashing node pairs up the tree to reach a calculated Merkle root. This root is compared to the expected value from the header. A fold operation is used for the Merkle tree traversal.

For interaction with the underlying chain, we might consider maps to simulate chain data, useful for testing and debugging.

SegWit transaction verification will involve the was-segwit-tx-mined-compact, identifying and validating the witness commitment in an output.

Verification flow will initially examine if the block header matches the expected height. Subsequently, it checks the Merkle proof for the transaction. Witness commitment verification is performed for SegWit transactions.

User-friendly functions, was-tx-mined-compact (regular transactions) and was-segwit-tx-mined-compact (SegWit transactions), summarize the verification.

Enforced buffer limits in Clarity are managed with calls such as unwrap-panic and as-max-len?, as Clarity has these restrictions.

Execution flow and error handling are vital. We will make use of try! and unwrap! to ensure deterministic execution and to handle failures correctly.

In conclusion, the contract must parse Bitcoin transactions, verify their integrity with cryptographic proofs, and account for various edge cases, all while respecting Clarity's limitations. The final contract will provide a complete system for verifying Bitcoin transactions for use within a Clarity-based blockchain.",";; title: stateless contract to verify bitcoin transaction

"Create a Clarity smart contract for an NFT collection with the following features: defining the NFT, managing token IDs, tracking ownership, allowing minting and transferring of tokens. The contract should also include error handling for situations like unauthorized actions and failed transactions, use a base URI for metadata, and confirm Bitcoin transaction status using an external library (clarity-bitcoin-lib-v5). The minting process should increase the token ID, check if the sender is the contract owner, verify Bitcoin transaction mining, and issue the token to a designated recipient. Transfers should only be permitted by the token's owner, and ownership should be updated correctly.","The task is to develop a Clarity smart contract for an NFT collection. The contract needs to handle token creation, ID management, ownership, minting, and transfers. It must adhere to a standard NFT trait. Error handling is crucial, covering unauthorized access, transfer issues, and Bitcoin transaction validation. State variables will track the NFT definition, the last token ID, and the base metadata URI. Key functions include a mint function (checking sender authorization, Bitcoin transaction validation via an external library, and token issuance) and a transfer function (verifying ownership and updating records). Read-only functions will provide NFT information (URI, owner). Bitcoin transaction validation is a key requirement, implying a cross-chain interaction. The mint function needs to manage token IDs, verify the contract owner, validate Bitcoin transactions, and mint. Robust error handling and appropriate return values (success or error) are essential. The transfer function must confirm the sender's ownership. Overall, the contract should securely manage NFTs, including minting linked to Bitcoin transactions and secure transfers.",";;title: btc-tx-enabled-nft

"Create a Clarity smart contract for a SIP-010 compliant fungible token. The contract should include: implementation of the SIP-010 trait; definition of a token named 'count-token';  error constants for unauthorized access and insufficient balance; setting the contract deployer as the owner; a mutable TOKEN-URI; constants for name, symbol, and decimals;  read-only functions for balance, total supply, name, symbol, decimals, and URI; and public functions for updating URI (owner only), minting, burning (with STX fallback), and transferring tokens (with optional memo and ownership checks).","The task is to generate a Clarity smart contract for a fungible token conforming to the SIP-010 standard, analogous to Ethereum's ERC-20. The process involves several steps:

1.  **SIP-010 Trait Implementation:**  Use `impl-trait` to adhere to the SIP-010 interface, referencing the standard trait definition.
2.  **Fungible Token Definition:** Define the token using `define-fungible-token` with the name 'count-token'.
3.  **Error Constants:** Define constants `ERR_OWNER_ONLY` (u100) and `ERR_NOT_TOKEN_OWNER` (u101) for access control.
4.  **Contract Owner:** Set `CONTRACT_OWNER` to `tx-sender` to store the deployer's address.
5.  **Mutable Token URI:** Create a mutable `TOKEN-URI` using `define-data-var` with an initial value. The type must be an Optional type.
6.  **Token Constants:** Define constants for `TOKEN_NAME`, `TOKEN_SYMBOL`, and `TOKEN_DECIMALS`.
7.  **Read-Only Functions:** Implement standard SIP-010 getters: `get-balance`, `get-total-supply`, `get-name`, `get-symbol`, `get-decimals`, and `get-token-uri`.
8.  **Public Functions:**
    *   **`set-token-uri`:**  Update `TOKEN-URI` (only callable by the contract owner).
    *   **Mint Function:**  Create a minting function, callable by a `.counter` contract.
    *   **Burn Function:** Create a burning function, callable by `.counter`, with a fallback to burn STX if insufficient token balance.
    *   **`transfer`:** Implement the SIP-010 `transfer` function, including an optional memo field and checks to ensure the sender is authorized.

 The contract should include all required functions, proper error handling, and appropriate permission checks, especially in the `transfer` function where flexibility in sender authorization must be carefully managed.",";;title:count-token

"Create a Clarity smart contract for a payment channel system on the Stacks blockchain. This system should facilitate off-chain transactions using both STX and SIP-010 tokens.  The contract must include functions for creating, updating, disputing, and settling payment channels. It should also incorporate robust security measures like signature verification and nonce management, and follow Stacks' best practices for security and performance.","The goal is to build a secure and efficient payment channel system on Stacks. Payment channels enable off-chain transactions, improving scalability and reducing fees. The core process involves parties opening a channel with initial deposits, conducting signed off-chain transactions, and finally closing the channel, settling the balances on-chain. Key functions include opening, updating, disputing, and closing channels. Signature verification is crucial for security. Channel state needs to track participants, balances, expiry, and nonces (to prevent replay attacks).  The design will start with defining constants, errors, and data structures.  The contract must support both STX and SIP-010 tokens, using a trait for flexibility and token-agnostic functions. Channel identification will use a deterministic method, sorting principals for a consistent key regardless of input order.  Security is paramount; channel operations require valid signatures, complying with SIP-018 to avoid replay attacks. Functions are needed to initialize, fund/open, cooperatively close, handle disputes (with timelocks), and allow unilateral closure. Deposit/withdrawal management during the channel's lifetime is essential. We need a robust design so maybe including an agent system is necessary.  A challenge period is needed for dispute resolution, allowing submission of newer states.  Signature verification is critical, covering all relevant data.  Edge cases, like unresponsive participants (requiring a force-close with a timeout), and invalid state transitions must be handled.  Payment execution involves escrow and correct distribution upon closure.  Consideration should be given to Hash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs) for conditional payments and atomic swaps.  Nonce management is vital; each update requires a higher nonce.  Maps with composite keys (participant addresses and token info) will store channel data.  Utility functions will improve readability and maintenance.  Specific error constants will aid debugging.  Security measures must prevent fund theft; only valid signed state updates are allowed.  Balance sums must remain consistent.  Events (via `print` statements) should track operations.  Withdrawals during the channel's life might improve capital efficiency. The final contract must be a secure, efficient, and user-friendly implementation of payment channels, suitable for the Stacks ecosystem.",";; title: stackflow

"Create a Clarity smart contract for a subnet. This contract should manage miners, register fungible and non-fungible token contracts, handle block commitments including withdrawal roots, process deposits and withdrawals (STX, fungible, and non-fungible tokens), validate operations using Merkle proofs, and manage asset transfers/minting securely. Base the implementation on the structure and logic inferred from the provided code (not provided here, but implied as a basis from the original instruction).","1. **Define Subnet Concept:** Understand that a subnet functions as a secondary blockchain tied to a main chain (L1), handling specific transactions and boosting scalability. The contract will manage asset movement between L1 and the subnet (L2).
2. **Error Constants:** Define error constants to give meaningful feedback during operation failures, covering cases like commit errors, invalid miners, transfer problems, and validation issues, improving user experience and debugging.
3. **Data Structures:** Set up maps to track block commits, withdrawal roots, and handled withdrawals. Also, set up a variable for the authorized miner to maintain subnet state and prevent double-spending.
4. **Traits for Interoperability:** Define traits for interacting with different token standards – NFTs, fungible tokens, and a subnet minting trait.  This allows uniform interaction with different token contracts.
5. **Miner Management:** Implement miner update functionality, allowing only the current miner to update to a new one, maintaining security.
6. **Token Registration:** Implement functions for registering both fungible and non-fungible token contracts (mapping L1 contracts to L2 counterparts).  Only the authorized miner should be able to register.
7. **Block Commitment:** Implement block commitment to anchor subnet state to the L1 chain. Each commitment should have a withdrawal root (Merkle root of withdrawals). Validate against committed blocks and miner authorization.
8. **NFT Deposit/Withdrawal:** Implement NFT deposit and withdrawal functions. Deposits involve users sending NFTs to the contract. Withdrawals require Merkle proof validation against the committed withdrawal root, then transferring the NFT.
9. **NFT Minting (if needed):** Include logic to mint NFTs if necessary during withdrawal (e.g., if an NFT originates on L2).
10. **FT Deposit/Withdrawal:** Implement similar functions for fungible tokens, also handling token amounts. Deposits involve sending tokens to the contract, and withdrawals need Merkle proof validation and transfers. Minting may be needed, if the contract lacks balance.
11. **STX Handling:** Implement STX deposit and withdrawal using `stx-transfer?`, as STX isn't a contract.  Use similar validation logic.
12. **Merkle Proof Validation:** This is crucial. Implement functions for hashing withdrawal data, verifying Merkle paths, and keeping track of processed withdrawals to prevent double-spending.
13. **Leaf Hashing:** Create distinct hashing formats for STX, NFT, and FT withdrawals. This creates unique identifiers for inclusion in the Merkle tree.
14. **Hash Verification:** Implement verification to traverse the Merkle tree using sibling hashes, reconstructing and comparing the root hash to the committed root.
15. **Mark Withdrawals Processed:** Function to mark withdrawals as processed after successful execution – avoiding multiple processing for the same withdrawal.
16. **Error Handling:** Throughout the code, ensure thorough error handling with input and state validation.  Provide specific error codes.
17. **Event Emission:** The contract should emit events for key actions like deposits and withdrawals for off-chain monitoring.
18. **Overall Design:** Ensure the complete design satisfies the requirements for a secure and well-managed subnet system.",";;title: subnet

"Create a Clarity smart contract for an NFT named ""funny-dog"" that adheres to the nft-trait interface.

Store the contract owner's address in a constant. Define constants for different error conditions (unauthorized access, invalid transfers, exceeding collection size). Store a base URI template as a data variable. Create read-only functions for fetching the last token ID, token URI, and token owner. Implement a public transfer function that verifies the sender's ownership before transferring. Create a mint function, restricted to the contract owner, that checks the collection limit, mints the token, updates the last token ID, and returns the new ID.

"Create a Clarity smart contract for a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace. This marketplace should enable users to offer NFTs for sale, remove their listings, and buy listed NFTs using either STX or other token types. The contract should handle errors such as listings that have passed their expiration date, actions attempted by unauthorized users, and discrepancies in asset types. It should also include a feature to approve specific asset contracts, validate the details of each listing, and have secure functions for moving NFTs and other tokens. The goal is to make the contract robust and efficient, excluding any deployment and testing features.","Design an NFT marketplace smart contract in Clarity. Start by defining the core functionalities: creating listings, removing listings, and buying listed NFTs using either STX or fungible tokens. This requires separate purchase handling for each payment type. Define necessary traits (NFT and FT) for interacting with various token contracts, including their transfer helper functions. Manage the marketplace's state with a map storing listing details (seller, optional buyer, token ID, NFT contract, expiry, price, payment asset), a listing ID counter, and a whitelist for approved asset contracts to enhance security. Define clear error codes for scenarios such as expired listings, unauthorized access, and asset mismatches to improve readability and maintainability. For the listing function, ensure NFT asset and payment asset are whitelisted and transfer NFT to contract escrow. Create cancellation function to verify caller and return NFT if validation passes. Implement fulfillment functions (STX and FT) verifying listing, caller, expiry, asset contracts, and transferring NFT and payment. Address security by ensuring authorized actions and safe asset transfers with as-contract usage when appropriate. Make functions like getters read-only to save gas. Add documentation using clear naming conventions for better maintainability.

"Create a Clarity smart contract for a decentralized NFT marketplace named 'tiny-market'. This contract should enable users to list NFTs for sale, cancel listings, and complete trades. It should support payments in STX and fungible tokens. Key features include whitelisting NFT contracts, storing listing details (seller, optional buyer, token ID, expiration, price, optional payment contract), checking expiration, validating prices, restricting payment assets, enforcing permissions, using NFT and FT traits, handling errors, and providing secure asset transfer functions.","1.  **Initial Setup**: Define the contract, utilizing traits for standard NFT and FT interactions. Establish a contract owner for administrative tasks. Create a `listings` map to store trade details (maker, taker, token ID, NFT contract, expiry, price, payment asset contract) and use `listing-nonce` variable for unique IDs. Create `whitelisted-asset-contracts` to manage the approved NFT contract for the marketplace.
2.  **Whitelist Management**: Implement `is-whitelisted` (read-only) to check if a contract is approved and `set-whitelisted` to allow the contract owner to manage the whitelist.
3.  **Helper Functions**: Create `transfer-nft` and `transfer-ft` to handle secure asset transfers using `contract-call?`.
4.  **Listing Assets**: Implement `list-asset` to allow users to list NFTs. Validate NFT contract whitelisting, expiry, price, an optional whitelisted payment asset. Transfer the NFT to the contract. Store listing and increment listing-nonce.
5.  **Retrieval and Cancellation**: Create `get-listing` (read-only) to fetch listing details. Implement the `cancel-listing` that only seller can cancel listing. Delete the listing and transferred back the asset.
6.  **Fulfillment Validation**: Create `assert-can-fulfil` to centralize checks: buyer != maker, taker matches caller (if specified), listing not expired, and correct NFT and payment assets used.
7.  **Fulfillment Functions**: Implement `fulfil-listing-stx` (for STX payments) and `fulfil-listing-ft` (for FT payments). Both functions should retrieve the listing, validate conditions, transfer NFT to buyer, transfer payment to seller, and remove the listing. Use `try!` for error handling and atomic transactions.
8 **Conclusion:** Ensure that there is secure and flexible NFT trading via robust state management, whitelisting, and transfer logic. The use of `try!` ensures that if any step fails, the entire transaction is reverted, preventing asset loss or unintended transfers.",";; title:tiny-market
