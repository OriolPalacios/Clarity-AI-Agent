Provide detailed comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each data structure and function in the contract.","I'll generate a detailed Chain-of-Thought explaining the reasoning process behind the Clarity smart contract implementation.

Let's start by understanding what we need to build: a decentralized lending protocol on the Stacks blockchain with STX tokens as the primary asset. The core functionality requires deposit management, borrowing against collateral, loan processing, and yield distribution.

First, the data structure design. The contract needs to track two primary types of data: deposits and loans. For deposits, a map structure is used to associate user principals (blockchain addresses) with their deposit amounts. This approach provides user-specific accounting while maintaining the simplicity needed for a lending protocol. Similarly, loans are tracked with a separate map associating borrowers with both their loan amounts and the block height of their last interaction, which is crucial for interest calculations.

Next, global state variables are defined. The total-deposits tracks the aggregate deposits in the contract, which is necessary for calculating proportional yields. The pool-reserve holds accumulated interest payments, effectively serving as the yield source for depositors. The loan-interest-rate is set at 10% as specified in the requirements.

Error constants are defined to handle various failure scenarios, providing clear feedback to users when operations fail. This follows best practices for smart contract development where error handling is crucial for security and user experience.

Moving to the functional implementation, the deposit function allows users to add STX to the contract. It uses stx-transfer? to move tokens from the user to the contract, updates the user's balance in the deposits map, and increases the total-deposits counter. The function uses a combination of let bindings and map operations to manage state transitions safely.

The borrow function implements the 50% loan-to-value ratio requirement. It calculates the allowed borrowing limit based on half the user's deposit (/ user-deposit u2), ensuring users can't borrow more than 50% of their collateral value. Before issuing new loans, it calculates any accrued interest on existing loans using the calculate-accrued-interest private function. The function then updates the loan record with the new total and the current block height for future interest calculations.

For repayments, the repay function first calculates the total amount due including accrued interest. It then ensures users don't overpay, transfers the repayment amount to the contract, and updates the loan record. Importantly, it adds the interest portion to the pool-reserve, making it available for yield distribution.

The claim-yield function distributes accumulated interest to depositors proportionally based on their share of the total deposits. This implements the yield earning requirement in the original specification. The calculation (/ (* (var-get pool-reserve) user-deposit) (var-get total-deposits)) determines each user's fair share of the yield.

The read-only functions get-balance-by-sender, get-balance, and get-amount-owed provide transparency, allowing users to query their current positions and obligations without modifying the contract state. This supports the requirement for comprehensive query functions.

Finally, the calculate-accrued-interest private function implements the dynamic interest calculation based on block height as required. It determines the elapsed time in blocks since the last loan interaction and calculates interest proportionally. The calculation (/ (* principal (var-get loan-interest-rate) elapsed-blocks) u10000) applies the 10% interest rate over the elapsed blocks.

Wait, there seems to be an error in the borrow function. The new-loan calculation is incomplete - it only adds the amount without including the existing loan or accrued interest. This might lead to incorrect loan accounting.

Overall, the implementation adheres to the required functionality: deposits with user-specific balances, a loan system with dynamic interest calculations, yield distribution, a 50% loan-to-value ratio, a 10% interest rate, and comprehensive error handling. The contract includes both the required functionality and the necessary read-only functions for querying balances and loan amounts.",";; Define the contract's data variables

"Create a Clarity smart contract for the Stacks blockchain that implements a minimal NFT marketplace allowing users to list NFTs for sale with configurable parameters including token ID, expiry, price, payment asset type (STX or SIP010 tokens), and optional intended buyer. Include functionality for whitelisting contracts, listing assets, canceling listings, and fulfilling purchases with both STX and fungible tokens. Implement proper error handling, security checks, and use the standard NFT and fungible token traits for compatibility.","## Chain-of-Thought Analysis: NFT Marketplace Smart Contract

First, I need to understand the requirements for this smart contract. We need to create a marketplace for NFTs on the Stacks blockchain where users can list their tokens with configurable parameters. These parameters include token ID, expiry, price, payment type, and optional intended buyer. The contract should also handle whitelisting, asset management, and transaction processing with both STX and fungible tokens.

Wait, before designing the implementation, I should consider the technical constraints of the Clarity language and Stacks blockchain. Clarity is a decidable language designed for financial use cases, with strict typing and no reentrancy vulnerabilities. This makes it suitable for a marketplace where asset ownership and payments need to be securely managed.

Let's see, one of the fundamental design decisions is how to structure the state storage for listings. The implemented solution uses a map with unique integer IDs as keys, which provides efficient lookup. Each listing needs to store all configurable parameters, so the map value contains fields for the maker, optional taker, token ID, NFT contract, expiry, price, and payment asset contract. This directly maps to the requirements for configurable parameters.

Then, we need a mechanism to generate unique IDs for listings. The chosen approach uses a nonce variable that increments with each new listing. This is a simple yet effective way to ensure each listing has a unique identifier without collisions.

Okay, security is a critical concern for a marketplace handling valuable assets. The contract implements a whitelist mechanism to control which contracts can interact with the marketplace. This prevents potentially malicious contracts from being used, adding a layer of security. The whitelist is managed through a separate map and controlled by the contract owner, following the principle of least privilege.

The error handling approach is comprehensive, with distinct error codes for different failure scenarios. This makes debugging easier and provides clear feedback to users about why operations failed. The errors are logically organized into listing-related and fulfillment-related categories.

Now, for the core functionality, the contract needs to enable listing, viewing, canceling, and fulfilling purchases. The list-asset function incorporates several validation checks: ensuring the contract is whitelisted, the expiry is valid, the price is non-zero, and the payment contract is approved. After validation, it transfers the NFT to the marketplace contract and records the listing details.

The get-listing function is straightforward, simply retrieving listing information by ID. This read-only function is essential for marketplace transparency, allowing users to view listing details.

For cancellation, the cancel-listing function includes critical authorization checks to ensure only the original maker can cancel a listing. It also verifies the NFT contract matches the one in the listing before returning the NFT to the maker and removing the listing from the map.

The fulfillment process is split into two functions: one for STX payments and another for fungible token payments. Both share validation logic through the assert-can-fulfil function, which checks that the buyer isn't the maker, the intended taker is valid, the listing isn't expired, and the asset contracts match. This validation ensures the integrity of the transaction.

May I emphasize the smart use of helper functions for token transfers. The transfer-nft and transfer-ft functions abstract the specifics of token transfers, making the code more maintainable and reducing duplication. This is particularly important given that the contract handles both NFT and fungible token transfers.

The contract also leverages the as-contract context when transferring assets. This is a crucial security feature in Clarity that allows the contract to act on behalf of itself, ensuring proper authorization during token transfers.

Let me look at how the contract handles the payment process. For STX payments, it uses the built-in stx-transfer? function, while for fungible tokens, it uses the transfer-ft helper function. Both approaches ensure that payment is sent from the buyer to the seller, completing the exchange.

I notice that the contract doesn't include a commission mechanism for the marketplace. This keeps the implementation minimal as required, though in a production environment, a fee structure might be added.

The transaction flow is well-designed: first validate all conditions, then transfer the NFT to the buyer, then process the payment, and finally update the state by removing the listing. This sequence ensures that transactions are atomic and prevents partial execution.

Then, thinking about edge cases, the contract handles scenarios like expired listings, unauthorized attempts to cancel, and unexpected asset contracts. This comprehensive error handling makes the contract robust and secure.

In conclusion, the smart contract elegantly addresses all the requirements by implementing a clear data structure for listings, secure whitelisting mechanisms, comprehensive validation checks, and separate functions for different payment types. The design follows good software engineering principles like separation of concerns, proper error handling, and code reuse, resulting in a minimal yet complete NFT marketplace implementation.",";; A tiny NFT marketplace that allows users to list NFT for sale.

Ensure proper error handling and assertions throughout all functions to maintain security and expected behavior.","First, I need to implement a Clarity smart contract for the Stacks blockchain that follows the SIP-009 NFT standard. To ensure compatibility with other applications and services, I'll start by implementing the required trait from its canonical location. This establishes that my contract adheres to the expected interface and behavior of NFTs on the Stacks blockchain.

Next, I need to define the actual NFT token. I'll use ""Your-NFT-Name"" as a placeholder that can be customized later, and specify that token IDs will be represented as unsigned integers. This is a common pattern for NFTs, where each token has a unique numerical identifier.

Let's see, I need a way to track which tokens have been minted. The simplest approach is to use a counter variable that gets incremented with each mint. I'll define a data variable initialized to zero that will store the last token ID that was created. This helps maintain the state of the contract and ensures token IDs are sequential and unique.

Then, I need to set up some important constants. The contract owner should be whoever deploys the contract, so using tx-sender makes sense here. I also need to enforce a collection limit of 1000 tokens as specified, so I'll define that as a constant. For proper error handling, I should define specific error codes for common failure scenarios like unauthorized access attempts or hitting the collection limit.

Wait, I also need somewhere to store metadata about the tokens. Following best practices, I'll define a base URI string variable that can point to the metadata for all tokens in the collection. This URI template can include a placeholder for the token ID, allowing each token to have its own metadata while sharing the same base path.

Okay, now I need to implement the required SIP-009 functions. First is get-last-token-id which simply returns the current counter value - this lets applications know how many tokens have been minted. Next is get-token-uri which returns the URI for a specific token's metadata. Then get-owner to check who owns a particular token, which uses the built-in nft-get-owner? function. Finally, the transfer function that allows owners to send their tokens to others.

For the transfer function, security is critical. I must verify that the caller is actually the owner of the token being transferred. This prevents unauthorized transfers and protects users' assets. I'll use an assertion to check that the transaction sender matches the specified sender parameter, returning an error if they don't match.

Now for the mint function, which needs several safeguards. First, I should calculate the new token ID by incrementing the last one. Then I must check that we haven't exceeded the collection limit, otherwise return an error. I also need to verify that only the contract owner can call this function. If all checks pass, I can mint the token to the specified recipient, update the last token ID counter, and return the new token ID.

Finally, I should make sure all functions return properly formatted responses. For read-only functions, wrapping the result in an (ok ...) tuple ensures compatibility with the SIP-009 standard. For state-changing functions, using try! for operations that might fail allows for proper error propagation, while asserts! provides clean permission checking and validation. This approach to error handling makes the contract more robust and user-friendly.",";; This contract implements the SIP-009 community-standard Non-Fungible Token trait

"Generate a Clarity smart contract for Stacks Blockchain that implements a SIP-013 semi-fungible token with both 'sip013-semi-fungible-token-trait' and 'sip013-transfer-many-trait' from 'SPDBEG5X8XD50SPM1JJH0E5CTXGDV5NJTKAKKR5V'. The contract should define a fungible token, a non-fungible token ID system, and maps for balances and supplies. Include functions for transfers (single and batch, with and without memos), balance queries, supply tracking, and owner-only minting. Implement proper error handling, access controls, and event logging while maintaining token ID ownership using the non-fungible token tagging system.","First, I notice there's a significant mismatch between the question and the provided code. The question asks for a SIP-009 NFT standard implementation with specific features like a collection limit of 1000 tokens and a ""Your-NFT-Name"" token. However, the code implements a SIP-013 semi-fungible token standard instead, which is fundamentally different.

Let's see what's happening here. The code implements two traits: 'sip013-semi-fungible-token-trait' and 'sip013-transfer-many-trait' rather than the SIP-009 NFT standard mentioned in the question. This indicates a complete shift in the token standard being implemented.

The provided code creates a semi-fungible token system which combines aspects of both fungible and non-fungible tokens. It defines a fungible token called ""semi-fungible-token"" and a non-fungible token called ""semi-fungible-token-id"" with a composite key structure. This design allows tracking ownership of specific token IDs with varying amounts, unlike the pure NFT model requested in the question.

Wait, there's also no implementation of the collection limit of 1000 tokens mentioned in the question. Instead, the code provides a general-purpose implementation that can mint any amount of any token ID without restrictions. This further confirms the divergence from the requirements.

Then we have the storage structure. The code uses data maps to track token balances and supplies, which makes sense for a semi-fungible token where users can own multiple units of the same token ID. This differs from a pure NFT where ownership is binary - either you own it or you don't.

The error handling in the code addresses ownership verification with 'err-owner-only' and balance checks with 'err-insufficient-balance', but nothing specifically about collection limits as requested in the question. The code has proper sender verification in the transfer function, which aligns with general security practices mentioned in the question.

Okay, examining the functions, the code implements all required SIP-013 functions, including balance queries, supply tracking, and transfer capabilities. It even includes batch transfer functionality through 'transfer-many' and 'transfer-many-memo', which wasn't mentioned in the original question but is part of the SIP-013 standard.

The mint function does include owner-only restrictions as requested, but it doesn't increment any token ID counter or enforce collection limits. Instead, it allows the owner to specify any token ID and amount during minting, which is appropriate for semi-fungible tokens but not for the sequential NFT minting requested.

Maybe the most telling discrepancy is that there's no implementation of 'get-last-token-id' function requested in the question. This function would be critical for an NFT with sequential minting but is unnecessary in a semi-fungible token implementation.

The code does include a clever 'tag-nft-token-id' helper function that manages the non-fungible aspects of token ownership, creating a hybrid token system that can track both quantity (fungible aspect) and specific ownership (non-fungible aspect).

In conclusion, the provided code is a well-structured implementation of the SIP-013 semi-fungible token standard, but it doesn't address the requirements specified in the question, which asked for a SIP-009 NFT implementation with sequential minting and collection limits.","(impl-trait 'SPDBEG5X8XD50SPM1JJH0E5CTXGDV5NJTKAKKR5V.sip013-semi-fungible-token-trait.sip013-semi-fungible-token-trait)

"Create a Clarity smart contract for a bridged stablecoin token on the Stacks blockchain. The contract should implement the SIP-10 token standard and additional traits for bridging functionality. Include administrative features such as ownership control, minting allowances, token pausing capability, and address banning. The token should have configurable metadata (name, symbol, URI) and precise decimal handling. Implement core token operations (transfer, mint, burn) with appropriate security checks and error handling. Add an extension system allowing authorized contracts to interact with the token through a controlled interface. Ensure all operations emit relevant events for tracking and include comprehensive error codes. The initial token state should be paused until explicitly activated by the contract owner, and all sensitive functions should verify caller authorization before execution.","First, the contract starts by implementing multiple traits which establish its interfaces. The SIP-10 trait is crucial as it defines the standard token interface on Stacks. The additional traits for bridging and extension capabilities allow the token to interact with external systems and be extended with new functionality over time.

The contract then defines a series of error constants with descriptive codes. This approach centralizes error handling and makes the code more maintainable. The constants use a consistent numbering scheme starting at u10000, which allows for clear error identification when issues occur.

Let's see how the state management is implemented. The contract uses a combination of data variables and maps to store its state. Token metadata is stored in string variables with appropriate size limits. The core token balance data is handled through the built-in fungible-token type, which provides atomic operations and consistency guarantees. Maps are used for tracking minter allowances and banned addresses, which enables efficient lookups.

Wait, we need to consider the security model. The contract implements a robust ownership system where sensitive operations require the caller to be the contract owner. This pattern appears consistently throughout the code. The token also starts in a paused state (token-pause is initially true), requiring explicit activation by the owner before transfers can occur.

The minting system uses a dual-map approach to both define allowances and track usage. This prevents minters from exceeding their allowed limits and provides an audit trail. Each mint operation updates the tracking map, ensuring that accumulated mints don't exceed the allowance.

Okay, then the SIP-10 implementation provides the standard interface functions that other contracts expect. These read-only functions allow external contracts to query metadata and balances. The transfer function notably delegates to an internal transfer! function that includes additional checks.

Looking at the administrative functions, they all follow a consistent pattern: verify authorization, perform the operation, emit an event, and return success. This consistency makes the contract more predictable and easier to reason about. The events emitted through the print function enable off-chain monitoring of important state changes.

The address banning system provides a way to restrict malicious users from transferring tokens. The transfer! function checks both sender and recipient against the banned addresses map, preventing sanctioned addresses from using the token.

The extension system is particularly sophisticated. It allows the token to interact with authorized external contracts in a controlled manner. Extensions must be explicitly authorized by the owner, and there's a mechanism to revoke this authorization if needed. The run-extension! function uses as-contract to execute extension code with the token's context, allowing controlled access to internal functions.

The error handling throughout the code is comprehensive. Each function performs appropriate validation before executing its core logic. The use of unwrap! and match expressions handles potential failures in a controlled way. This prevents inconsistent states and improves security.

Finally, the token implements memo support, which is important for compliance and record-keeping in financial applications. All transfer operations support an optional memo field that gets emitted in events, allowing off-chain systems to track additional context for transactions.",";; title: circle-usdce-token

"Create a Clarity smart contract for Stacks blockchain that functions as a simple bank or ""piggy bank"" where users can deposit and withdraw STX tokens. The contract should maintain a map of user accounts with their balances, implement secure deposit functionality, and demonstrate multiple withdrawal implementations with varying security patterns (including an intentionally unsafe version for educational purposes). Include read-only balance checking, administrative functions allowing a bank owner to withdraw from any account, and a time-based withdrawal feature that unlocks after a certain block height. The contract should serve as an educational example with clear comments explaining security considerations, input validation techniques, and demonstrate both proper error handling with constants and the use of Clarity's security features like assertions and conditional checks.","First, I need to identify the core requirements for this piggy bank contract. The question asks for a bank-like system where users can deposit and withdraw STX tokens with their balances tracked. It specifically mentions multiple withdrawal implementations with varying security patterns and administrative functions.

Looking at the contract structure, it begins by defining error constants, which addresses the requirement for ""proper error handling with constants."" The two error types - insufficient balance and unauthorized access - cover the critical failure modes for this banking application.

Next, the contract establishes a data map called ""accounts"" to track balances. This directly implements the requirement to ""maintain a map of user accounts with their balances"" by associating each principal (user address) with their token amount stored as an integer.

The deposit function handles the first core requirement. It retrieves the current balance using map-get?, adds the deposit amount after converting it to an integer, updates the map, and transfers tokens to the contract. The implementation includes a comment about allowing unchecked data since the STX transfer will fail and rollback operations if the sender lacks sufficient tokens.

Now for the withdrawal implementations. The contract includes multiple versions as required, starting with an intentionally unsafe version that lacks balance validation. This educational ""anti-pattern"" shows what happens when input validation is missing - allowing users to potentially withdraw more than they deposited.

Then, the contract implements three secure withdrawal variants. The standard ""withdrawal"" function uses assertions to validate the user has sufficient balance before proceeding. The ""withdrawal-if"" function accomplishes the same security check using conditional logic instead. The ""withdrawal-callee-filter"" demonstrates a more modular approach by delegating the validation to a separate helper function. These implementations directly satisfy the requirement to ""demonstrate multiple withdrawal implementations with varying security patterns.""

Wait, there's also the read-only function requirement. The contract includes ""get-balance"" which allows users to check their current balance without modifying state, implementing precisely what was required.

Looking at administrative features, the contract defines a bank-owner variable and implements a ""take"" function that allows this owner to withdraw from any account, satisfying the requirement for ""administrative functions allowing a bank owner to withdraw from any account."" It includes proper authorization checks to ensure only the bank owner can call this function.

Finally, the contract includes a time-based feature with ""take-after-time"" and an expiration-height variable that allows funds to be withdrawn after a certain block height, fulfilling the requirement for ""a time-based withdrawal feature that unlocks after a certain block height.""

Throughout the implementation, the code includes detailed comments explaining security considerations like tainted input, the check-checker's warnings, and annotations for security features. These comments serve the educational purpose specified in the requirements, highlighting both secure and insecure patterns in Clarity.

The contract effectively demonstrates Clarity's security features through assertions, conditional checks, and even optional annotations like filter() and allow(). Each function showcases different aspects of secure programming in Clarity, from basic validation to more advanced patterns like trusted sender checks and delegated validation.

Okay, so the implementation completely satisfies all the requirements from the question, providing a comprehensive educational example of a banking contract on the Stacks blockchain with appropriate error handling, security patterns, and administrative features.",";; bank

"I need you to create a Clarity smart contract for a fundraising campaign on the Stacks blockchain. The contract should allow donations in both STX and sBTC cryptocurrencies. It should include initialization functionality where I can set a funding goal and campaign duration, with a default duration of approximately 30 days (in Bitcoin blocks). The contract should track donations by donor address, allow the campaign owner to cancel the campaign, enable donors to request refunds if the campaign is cancelled, and allow the beneficiary to withdraw funds once the campaign ends. Please include appropriate error handling, getter functions to check campaign status and donation information, and ensure all functions have proper authorization checks. The contract should maintain data on total donations, campaign status, and individual contribution amounts.","First, I need to understand what we're trying to build: a fundraising campaign contract for the Stacks blockchain. This requires careful state management to track donations, campaign status, and handle various transactions securely.

Let's start with the core state management needs. The contract must maintain several pieces of crucial information: whether the campaign is initialized, cancelled or withdrawn, who the beneficiary is, timing parameters (duration and start), goal amounts, and donation tracking. These are implemented as data variables to maintain the contract's state across transactions.

Then, we need to track individual donations, which requires associating donor addresses with contribution amounts. Maps are the appropriate data structure here - one for STX donations and another for sBTC, both using the donor's principal (address) as the key.

Wait, error handling is critical for blockchain contracts. I should define error constants upfront to make the code more readable and maintainable. These error codes (like err-not-authorized, err-campaign-ended) help provide clear feedback when operations fail.

Now for campaign initialization. The initialize-campaign function needs ownership validation (only the contract owner can initialize), checks to prevent double-initialization, and logic to set campaign parameters. Including a default duration option (approximately 30 days in Bitcoin blocks) adds flexibility.

Okay, campaign management requires capabilities to cancel campaigns and handle funds. The cancel-campaign function includes proper authorization checks, ensures the campaign was initialized, and prevents cancellation after funds have been withdrawn.

The donation functionality needs separate methods for STX and sBTC. Both donation functions must verify the campaign is initialized and active, check that the campaign hasn't ended, transfer the funds to the contract, update the donor's contribution records, and increment total donation amounts.

For fund withdrawal, security is paramount. The withdraw function must verify proper authorization (only the beneficiary can withdraw), ensure the campaign is active and hasn't been withdrawn from already, and confirm the campaign period has ended. Then it needs to handle the actual transfer of both STX and sBTC assets to the beneficiary.

The refund mechanism must only function when the campaign is cancelled. It retrieves the donor's contributions, transfers the appropriate assets back, and cleans up the donation records.

Finally, read-only getter functions provide transparency and data access without modifying state. These functions allow checking individual donations, viewing overall campaign metrics, and monitoring the contract's balance.

Looking at the implementation, I can see the code addresses all requirements through a logical structure that handles campaign lifecycle, donations, withdrawals, and refunds with appropriate authorization and state management.",";; Fundraising Campaign Contract

"Create a Clarity smart contract for Stacks Blockchain that implements a payment streaming protocol. The contract should allow users to create streams of sBTC payments that automatically transfer funds from sender to recipient gradually over a specified number of blocks. Include functionality for creating new streams, refueling existing streams, withdrawing accumulated funds (for recipients), refunding unused funds (for senders after the stream ends), and allowing both parties to update stream parameters with mutual consent verified by cryptographic signatures. The contract should maintain a mapping of streams with their properties including sender, recipient, balance, withdrawn amount, payment rate, and timeframe details. Implement proper error handling for unauthorized access, invalid signatures, active streams, and non-existent stream IDs. Also include helper functions to calculate available balances and block deltas.","First, I need to understand what the contract aims to accomplish: a payment streaming protocol for Stacks Blockchain using Clarity. The fundamental concept here is to allow gradual transfers of sBTC from a sender to a recipient over a specified timeframe measured in blocks, rather than sending the entire amount at once.

Let's start by examining the state management approach. The contract needs to track multiple payment streams, each with its own properties. This naturally calls for a mapping data structure, which is implemented through the ""streams"" map using unique stream IDs as keys. Each stream stores essential information: the sender, recipient, total balance, withdrawn amount, payment rate, and time boundaries.

Next, the contract requires a way to generate unique identifiers for each stream. This is handled through a ""latest-stream-id"" data variable that incrementally increases with each new stream creation, ensuring uniqueness and proper record-keeping.

For the core functionality, the contract must implement several operations. The most fundamental is ""stream-to,"" which creates a new payment stream. This function locks the initial balance from the sender by transferring sBTC to the contract, sets up the stream parameters, and returns the stream ID. The implementation uses ""contract-caller"" to identify the sender, enforcing that the person creating the stream is the one funding it.

Then, we have the ""refuel"" function. This addresses the need to add more funds to an existing stream without altering other parameters. The function checks that only the original sender can add funds, ensuring proper authorization. It then transfers additional sBTC to the contract and updates the stream's balance.

Wait, how do we calculate how much of the funds has been ""streamed"" at any point? This is handled by ""calculate-block-delta"" and ""balance-of"" functions. The first determines how many blocks have passed in the stream's lifetime, considering the current block height against the start and stop blocks. The second uses this delta to calculate the exact amounts available to both the sender and recipient based on the payment rate and time elapsed.

Now, for the withdrawal mechanics. The ""withdraw"" function allows the recipient to claim their accumulated funds. It verifies the caller is the legitimate recipient, calculates the available balance, updates the withdrawn amount, and transfers the sBTC. This ensures recipients can access their funds without waiting for the entire stream to finish.

Similarly, ""refund"" lets senders reclaim excess funds after a stream ends. It verifies the stream has concluded by checking if the current block height exceeds the stop block, preventing premature withdrawals. This protects the recipient's interests while allowing senders to retrieve unused funds.

Okay, but what about modifications to stream parameters? The contract includes an update mechanism through ""update-details,"" but this requires consent from both parties to prevent unilateral changes. This is cleverly implemented using cryptographic signatures: one party proposes changes and the other signs off on them. The ""hash-stream"" and ""validate-signature"" functions support this by creating a hash of the proposed changes and verifying the signature against it.

The contract's error handling is thorough, with distinct error codes for different scenarios: unauthorized access, invalid signatures, attempts to refund active streams, and references to non-existent streams. This makes the contract more robust and helps users identify issues.

Then, there's the interesting decision to make some functions read-only (like ""balance-of"" and ""calculate-block-delta""). This optimizes gas usage since these operations only read state without modifying it. They serve as helper functions for both the contract's internal logic and external queries.

Finally, the implementation carefully manages the transfer of sBTC tokens using the standard token interface through ""contract-call?"" to interact with the sBTC token contract. The ""as-contract"" pattern is used for withdrawals and refunds to ensure the contract itself initiates these transfers, maintaining proper custody of funds throughout the stream's lifecycle.",";; payment-stream.clar

"Create a time-locked wallet smart contract in Clarity language for the Stacks blockchain that allows the contract owner to lock STX tokens for a designated beneficiary until a specific block height is reached. The contract should include a lock function that permits the owner to specify the beneficiary, set a future unlock height, and deposit tokens; a bestow function allowing the current beneficiary to transfer their rights; and a claim function enabling the beneficiary to withdraw all tokens after the unlock height is reached. Include appropriate error handling for owner-only operations, preventing multiple locks, ensuring the unlock height is in the future, validating token amounts, restricting beneficiary-only actions, and preventing premature withdrawals. Use data variables to track the beneficiary (initially none) and unlock height (initially zero). Name it ""timelocked-wallet"" and add explanatory comments about its purpose.","First, I need to understand what the question is asking for: a time-locked wallet in Clarity language for the Stacks blockchain. This requires knowledge of Clarity's syntax and blockchain concepts like principals, token transfers, and block heights.
Let's see what core functionality is needed. The contract must lock STX tokens until a specific block height is reached, with three main functions: lock, bestow, and claim. The contract owner should be able to lock tokens for a beneficiary, the beneficiary should be able to transfer rights, and finally claim the tokens after the unlock height.
Okay, starting with the contract's foundational structure, the code begins with comments explaining the purpose—a time-locked vault that allows claiming after a certain block height. It then defines the contract owner as the transaction sender (tx-sender), which establishes ownership at contract deployment time.
Then, the code defines error constants with meaningful names and unique error codes. This is good practice for smart contracts as it makes error handling more explicit and debugging easier. The errors cover all the requirements: owner-only operations, preventing multiple locks, ensuring future unlock heights, validating amounts, restricting beneficiary actions, and preventing premature withdrawals.
Next, the data variables are established. The beneficiary is defined as an optional principal type (allowing it to be ""none"") and the unlock height as a uint initialized to zero. These align with the requirement to track the beneficiary and unlock height with initial values of none and zero respectively.
For the lock function, it first performs several assertions to validate the operation. It checks that the sender is the contract owner, the beneficiary is currently none (preventing multiple locks), the unlock height is in the future, and the amount is greater than zero. Then it transfers the STX tokens from the sender to the contract itself using stx-transfer?, sets the beneficiary and unlock height variables, and returns ok true on success.
The bestow function allows the current beneficiary to transfer their rights to a new beneficiary. It first asserts that the transaction sender is the current beneficiary, then updates the beneficiary variable to the new beneficiary, and returns ok true.
Finally, the claim function enables the beneficiary to withdraw all tokens after the unlock height is reached. It asserts that the transaction sender is the current beneficiary and that the current block height is greater than or equal to the unlock height. Then it transfers all STX tokens from the contract to the beneficiary using as-contract to execute the transfer as the contract itself.
Wait, there's an important design consideration in the claim function. It uses stx-get-balance to determine how many tokens to transfer, ensuring all tokens in the contract are sent. It also uses unwrap-panic to extract the principal from the optional beneficiary, which is safe because the assertion earlier guarantees the beneficiary exists.
Throughout the code, the assertions use the error constants defined at the beginning, providing clear error messages when operations fail due to unmet conditions. This approach makes the contract more user-friendly and facilitates debugging.
To summarize, the code fully implements the requirements with careful design considerations for security, usability, and maintainability. It handles edge cases appropriately, uses Clarity's type system effectively, and follows best practices for smart contract development on the Stacks blockchain.",";; timelocked-wallet

"I need a Clarity smart contract for a fungible token on Stacks blockchain called ""Clarity Coin"" with symbol ""CC"" that implements the SIP-010 standard. The token should have no maximum supply, with only the contract owner able to mint new tokens. Include standard functions like transfer (with sender verification and optional memo parameter), plus all required read-only functions (get-name, get-symbol, get-decimals, get-balance, get-total-supply, get-token-uri). Add appropriate error constants for unauthorized minting attempts and invalid transfer attempts.","First, I need to implement the SIP-010 standard trait for fungible tokens on Stacks. This is accomplished by the initial line that implements the trait from its standard location at 'SP3FBR2AGK5H9QBDH3EEN6DF8EK8JY7RX8QJ5SVTE.sip-010-trait-ft-standard.sip-010-trait'. This ensures the contract adheres to the expected interface for fungible tokens.

Next, I need to establish ownership and access control. The contract sets the deployer (tx-sender at deployment time) as the contract-owner using a constant definition. This will be used later to restrict certain functions. I'll also need error codes, so I define two constants: err-owner-only (u100) for unauthorized minting attempts and err-not-token-owner (u101) for invalid transfer attempts.

Now for the core token functionality. Since the requirement specifies no maximum supply, I simply define a fungible token called 'clarity-coin' without any supply cap. This creates the base token that will be managed by this contract.

Let's implement the transfer function as required. It needs to verify the sender, handle the actual transfer, and process an optional memo. The function takes four parameters: amount, sender, recipient, and an optional memo buffer. The function first asserts that the transaction sender is the same as the specified sender using the asserts! function, which will return err-not-token-owner if false. Then it attempts the transfer using ft-transfer?, capturing any errors with try!. Finally, it handles the memo parameter using match - if a memo is provided, it prints it; otherwise, it returns a default byte 0x.

Then I need to implement all the required read-only functions specified by the SIP-010 standard. get-name returns ""Clarity Coin"" as specified in the requirements. get-symbol returns ""CC"" as required. get-decimals returns u0 indicating no decimal places. get-balance uses the built-in ft-get-balance function to retrieve a principal's token balance. get-total-supply uses ft-get-supply to get the current total supply. get-token-uri returns none since no URI was specified in the requirements.

Finally, I need a mint function that's restricted to the owner only. This function takes an amount and recipient, checks that the caller is the contract owner using asserts!, and then mints the specified amount to the recipient using ft-mint?. This satisfies the requirement that only the contract owner can mint new tokens.

Wait, I should check if I've covered all requirements. The contract implements SIP-010, handles token transfers with sender verification, includes an optional memo parameter, has all required read-only functions, restricts minting to the owner, has no maximum supply, and includes appropriate error constants. Yes, all requirements have been addressed in the code.","(impl-trait 'SP3FBR2AGK5H9QBDH3EEN6DF8EK8JY7RX8QJ5SVTE.sip-010-trait-ft-standard.sip-010-trait)

"Create a Stacks blockchain NFT smart contract using Clarity language that implements the nft-trait standard. The contract should manage a non-fungible token collection called ""stacksies"" with sequential token IDs tracked by a data variable. Include functionality for the contract owner to mint new tokens, allow token owners to transfer their tokens, and provide read-only functions to query token information (last token ID, token URI, and token ownership). Implement proper error handling for permission checks, ensuring only the contract owner can mint tokens and only token owners can transfer them. The contract should follow Clarity best practices with appropriate constants, data variables, and clearly defined public and read-only functions.","First, I need to understand the question's requirements: creating an NFT smart contract on Stacks that follows the nft-trait standard, manages ""stacksies"" tokens, and includes proper functionality and error handling. The contract must allow minting by the owner and transfers by token owners, plus provide read-only query functions.

Let's analyze how the response code implements these requirements. The first line implements the standard NFT trait from a specific principal address, which ensures our contract follows the expected interface for NFTs on the Stacks blockchain. Next, the code establishes key constants: contract-owner is set to tx-sender (the deployer of the contract), and two error constants are defined for permission checks.

Then, the core NFT definition is created with ""define-non-fungible-token stacksies uint"" which names our token collection ""stacksies"" and uses integers as token IDs. A data variable ""last-token-id"" is initialized to zero to track the sequential token IDs.

For the read-only functions, the code implements three required methods: get-last-token-id returns the current highest token ID, get-token-uri returns information about a specific token (though currently returns none as a placeholder), and get-owner returns the principal that owns a given token ID.

The transfer function handles ownership transfers with proper permission checks. It uses ""asserts!"" to verify that the transaction sender is the same as the provided sender argument, returning the not-token-owner error if this check fails. If the check passes, it attempts to transfer the NFT using the built-in nft-transfer? function.

Finally, the mint function implements the creation of new tokens. It calculates the next token ID by incrementing the last-token-id, verifies the caller is the contract owner, mints the token to the specified recipient, updates the last-token-id variable, and returns the new token ID. The permission check is critical here, ensuring only the contract owner can create new tokens.

Overall, the response code addresses all requirements from the question with a clean implementation that follows Clarity best practices. The code is minimal yet complete, with proper error handling and clear delineation between public and read-only functions.","(impl-trait 'SP2PABAF9FTAJYNFZH93XENAJ8FVY99RRM50D2JG9.nft-trait.nft-trait)

"Create a Clarity smart contract on Stacks that retrieves real-time price data for a specific asset (e.g., BTC/USD) from the Pyth Network using the Stacks-Pyth Bridge. Include deployment and testing instructions.","Okay, the user wants me to create a Clarity smart contract that retrieves real-time BTC/USD price data from the Pyth Network using the Stacks-Pyth Bridge. To begin, let’s recall the necessary integration steps between the Pyth Network and Stacks. The Stacks-Pyth Bridge likely involves certain traits and contracts, such as the pyth-storage-trait and pyth-decoder-trait, to ensure proper interaction with the Pyth Oracle and the retrieval of price data.

First, I’ll need to define key constants for the contract addresses—specifically, the Pyth Oracle contract and the storage contract. These constants will also include the 32-byte BTC/USD feed ID in hex, which is crucial for querying the price data. From earlier examples, it’s clear that using define-constant for these addresses and the feed ID is essential.

The main function will call the Pyth Oracle contract's get-price method, passing in the feed ID and the storage contract address as parameters. It’s important to ensure that the storage contract is passed correctly—perhaps by using as-contract to change the caller context if needed, as seen in previous examples where the storage contract address was passed with as-contract PYTH-STORAGE. This step is crucial because the storage contract may require the correct context to properly retrieve the price data.

Error handling is also key. Previous examples used try! and unwrap! to manage errors such as invalid storage addresses or stale data, and it’s important to decide whether a read-only function will suffice for this task. Since the user’s task is to ""retrieve real-time price data,"" a read-only function might be appropriate, but it depends on the implementation of the Oracle’s get-price function. If the get-price function requires state changes, a public function may be necessary. The user’s earlier code example used define-public for a public function, so it’s likely the best approach here.

Additionally, given the complexity of the task and the need for clear error handling, it’s important to decide whether the function should handle errors internally (using try!) or simply return the result of the contract call directly. A read-only function might just return the price, but if it’s a public function, it might return a response type (such as ok price or an error), requiring error propagation.

Given that the code must integrate the pyth-storage-trait to interact with the storage contract, the final code will use this trait along with the necessary constants for the oracle and storage contracts. The main function should be define-public, call the Oracle’s get-price, and handle any potential errors gracefully. If the storage contract requires specific handling via as-contract, this should be included to ensure proper context when interacting with the storage contract.

Lastly, thorough inline documentation will be included to explain each step and ensure that new developers can follow the logic. This includes details on the usage of the pyth-governance-v2 for governance checks, the rationale behind as-contract usage, and how the function handles different response types from the Oracle.

By modularizing the code with distinct responsibilities, such as governance verification, price retrieval, and error handling, I can facilitate easier testing with tools like Clarinet and ensure long-term maintainability. This structured approach will create a robust, clear blueprint for retrieving real-time BTC/USD price data from the Pyth Network.

"Create a simple Clarity smart contract for a token called 'MyToken' (symbol: MTK) with 8 decimal places.

Let users send tokens, approve others to spend their tokens, check balances, and view total supply. Include a way to revoke spending permissions and add this metadata link: ipfs://QmXwNHQ1BmE2hLRykAMMxjsmdeDGFSFg63KDMBUhtcMcKc.","Okay, the user wants a Clarity contract for a token named MyToken (symbol MTK) with 8 decimals, starting at 21 billion tokens, and initial allocations to two addresses. I begin by noting that the contract must implement standard fungible token functionality. To do this, I should define the fungible token using Clarity’s define-fungible-token, and set the total supply via a data variable to track the aggregate tokens in existence.

Wait, I need a map to track allowances between owners and spenders, ensuring that the transfer function checks allowances before executing a token transfer. I plan to implement private helper functions like allowance, increase-allowance, and decrease-allowance to manage these permissions. The approve function will call increase-allowance, and revoke will zero out the allowance, ensuring that users can control who is allowed to spend their tokens on their behalf.

Hmm, the transfer-from function must decrement the allowance after the transfer is executed, ensuring proper validation of the allowance before proceeding. Then, I’ll expose public functions like get-balance and get-total-supply using standard Clarity functions to interact with users. I might also include metadata functions that return the token's name, symbol, decimal places, and a URI stored on IPFS, which should be simple string returns.

I should also create a mint function that adjusts the total supply and initializes the token balances for the specified addresses, such as giving 200 tokens to one address and 100 to another during initialization. Error handling is key—so I need to ensure checks for non-negative amounts, valid allowances, and proper map updates for all transactions.

Maybe I’ll structure the contract with private internals for security, and public endpoints for user interactions, such as transferring tokens, approving and revoking spenders, and checking balances. This modular approach not only fulfills the functional requirements but also supports maintainability and ease of testing.

So, with clear inline documentation to explain each step—like why certain operations require wrapping storage logic or handling state changes in a particular order—this contract will be a robust, secure, and effective Clarity smart contract for MyToken.

"Create a Clarity smart contract for a Stacks blockchain multisig wallet that allows owner management (adding/removing with threshold checks), transaction submission/confirmation/revocation, and cross-chain token swaps via a magic bridge interface. Implement SIP-009/NFT and SIP-010/FT trait integrations for asset transfers, enforce access control through allowed callers, validate transaction confirmations against owner thresholds, and include error handling for ownership conflicts, invalid parameters, and unauthorized actions. Structure the code with clear comments, data maps for transactions/owners, and helper functions for internal state updates, ensuring all critical operations are guarded by sender authentication and parameter validity checks","The code implements a multi-signature wallet (Multisafe) in Clarity for the Stacks blockchain. Wait, I need to understand the core functionality first - this is a secure wallet requiring multiple confirmations before executing transactions. Okay, the contract starts by importing several traits (interfaces) that define the behavior of executors, safes, NFTs, fungible tokens, and a ""magic bridge"" for cross-chain functionality. The contract then implements the safe-trait interface, establishing itself as a safe.
The error constants are comprehensively defined to cover various failure scenarios, from authorization issues to transaction state problems. Maybe the most important design decision is using the contract itself as a constant (SELF) to reference its own principal, which enables the contract to perform actions as itself. The contract maintains crucial state variables: a list of wallet owners (limited to 20), a confirmation threshold, and a transaction nonce. Check these variables - they're fundamental to the multi-signature functionality.
The contract offers complete owner management with functions to add and remove owners, with careful validation to maintain security. The user wants the threshold to always be valid - it must be greater than zero and less than or equal to the number of owners. The transaction management implements a robust workflow: submit → confirm → execute. Wait, there's an interesting design here - transactions are stored in a map with detailed parameters and confirmation status, and owners can submit, confirm, and revoke their confirmations.
Might be worth noting the security design - most functions verify the caller is either the contract itself or an authorized owner. The contract also has special integration with a ""magic bridge"" for cross-chain functionality, allowing owners to initialize swappers and execute escrow swaps. Maybe the most elegant aspect is the initialization function that sets up the initial owners and threshold - in this case, three specific principals with a threshold of 2 (meaning any 2 of the 3 owners must confirm a transaction). Overall, the contract creates a secure, flexible multi-signature wallet with cross-chain capabilities.",";;title: safe-clar

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for a Stacks blockchain price oracle that retrieves real-time and historical BTC/USD prices from the Pyth Network’s pyth-storage-v3 contract, using a price feed ID while handling errors with granular codes. It should support historical price queries via at-block and Stacks block header hashes, integrate with the sbtc-token contract to fetch total supply, normalize values (dividing by 10^8 for precision), and compute the total sBTC value in USD. The contract must ensure robust error handling for failed external calls, invalid data, and arithmetic overflow while maintaining a structured design with read-only functions, type-safe validation, and clear dependencies on external traits/contracts.","Okay, this contract is designed to retrieve and process BTC/USD price data from the Pyth Network while ensuring error resilience and modularity. Wait, so the first thing to notice is the error-handling strategy. By defining `ERR_UNEXPECTED` as `u5000`, the contract ensures that unexpected failures are managed predictably, preventing issues from propagating unpredictably.  

Then, for fetching the real-time BTC price, the `get-btc-price` function interacts with `pyth-storage-v3` using `contract-call?`, passing the predefined price feed ID. Maybe the most important part here is how it handles responses: if the call succeeds, the function extracts and returns the price wrapped in `some`; otherwise, it returns `none`, making sure failure cases don’t cause execution failures.  

Wait, historical price retrieval works a bit differently. The function `get-btc-price-at` first fetches the block hash using `get-stacks-block-info?`, ensuring validity with `unwrap-panic`, which guarantees the hash exists. Then, it executes the price retrieval at that block using `at-block`, following the same safe pattern of error handling as the real-time price fetcher.  

Maybe integrating with the `sbtc-token` contract is where things get interesting. The `get-sbtc-total-supply` function retrieves the total supply of sBTC tokens safely using `contract-call?`, allowing seamless interaction with the token contract. Then, the final function, `get-sbtc-total-usd-value`, ties everything together. It fetches the total sBTC supply, normalizes it by dividing by `10^8`, does the same for the BTC price, and multiplies them to compute the total USD value. Might sound simple, but the use of `unwrap!` ensures that failed calls are caught early, avoiding unexpected runtime errors.  

So, what makes this contract well-structured? Every function is read-only, ensuring state safety and reusability. Dependencies on external contracts are cleanly managed, and type safety is enforced to prevent arithmetic overflow or invalid data handling. Then, by structuring the logic around modular, composable calls, the contract remains easy to maintain while achieving robust functionality.","(define-constant ERR_UNEXPECTED (err u5000))

"Write a Clarity smart contract that manages a counter with the following functionality: define constants for specific error codes, store a count variable, a contract owner, and a cost variable, implement read-only functions to get the current count and the count at a specific block, and create public functions to increment, decrement, and add to the counter while enforcing constraints like positive counts, limiting additions to more than one, and ensuring proper STX transfers for each operation based on the cost variable.","To begin addressing the requirements, the first step is to define constants for specific error codes. These constants serve as standardized identifiers for errors that might occur during the execution of the smart contract. For instance, ERR_COUNT_MUST_BE_POSITIVE ensures that the counter cannot drop below zero, while ERROR_ADD_MORE_THAN_ONE enforces a constraint on adding more than one to the counter at a time. Wait, there’s also ERR_BLOCK_NOT_FOUND, which handles cases where a block lookup fails. Defining these constants upfront makes the code more readable and maintainable.

Let's see, the next step involves managing state variables. The contract needs to store three key pieces of information: the current count (count), the contract owner (contract-owner), and the cost per operation (cost). Using define-data-var ensures these variables are mutable and can be updated during contract execution. The initial value for count is set to zero, contract-owner is initialized to the transaction sender (tx-sender), and cost is set to a fixed value of 10 STX. This setup allows the contract to track its state and enforce ownership and payment rules effectively.

Okay, then the focus shifts to implementing read-only functions. The get-count function retrieves the current value of the counter using var-get, providing a simple way for users to query the state without modifying it. Additionally, the get-count-at-block function uses at-block to retrieve the counter's value at a specific block height. This requires fetching the block's header hash using get-stacks-block-info?, and if the block is not found, the function returns the predefined ERR_BLOCK_NOT_FOUND. These read-only functions ensure transparency and provide historical data access.

Now, let’s consider the public functions that modify the state. The increment function increases the counter by one but requires the caller to pay the cost in STX to the contract owner. This is achieved using stx-transfer?, which ensures the payment is processed before updating the state. Similarly, the decrement function reduces the counter by one but includes a constraint to ensure the count remains positive. If the current count is zero, the function throws ERR_COUNT_MUST_BE_POSITIVE. This design prevents invalid states and aligns with the requirement for proper error handling.

Then, the add function introduces a more flexible operation, allowing the counter to increase by any value greater than one. However, this function also enforces constraints: it checks that the input n is greater than one using asserts!, throwing ERROR_ADD_MORE_THAN_ONE if the condition is violated. Additionally, the function calculates the total cost as n * cost and ensures the caller transfers the required STX amount. This approach maintains consistency with the payment model while expanding functionality.

Might be worth noting that all public functions use ok to return successful results after state modifications. This ensures that external callers receive clear feedback on the outcome of their transactions. Finally, the combination of error handling, state management, and payment enforcement creates a robust and secure smart contract that adheres to the specified requirements.",";;title: counter

"I need a smart contract written in Clarity that verifies Bitcoin transactions by checking the transaction details against a merkle proof and ensuring it matches the provided block header, while also validating witness data for SegWit transactions, incorporating error handling for various edge cases and maintaining strict data length checks throughout the contract logic.","First, I need to understand what this contract needs to accomplish. We need a smart contract in Clarity that can verify Bitcoin transactions by checking transaction details against merkle proofs and block headers. It also needs to handle SegWit transactions and include comprehensive error handling. This is a complex task that requires understanding both Bitcoin's transaction format and Clarity's capabilities.
Let's start by thinking about the error codes we'll need. When dealing with cryptographic verification, there are many failure points: out-of-bounds errors when reading data buffers, size constraint violations, invalid proofs, etc. I should define constants for each error case to make the code more readable and maintainable. These will be important throughout the contract since we'll be dealing with raw transaction data that could be malformed.
Now for reading Bitcoin data. Bitcoin transactions use variable-length fields, so I'll need helper functions to parse these different data types. First, I'll need basic readers for fixed-size integers: read-uint8, read-uint16, read-uint32, and read-uint64. Each of these will take a context (txbuff and current index) and return both the parsed value and an updated context with the index advanced.
For variable-length integers (varints), I'll need a special parser. Bitcoin encodes these with a prefix byte that determines how to interpret the following bytes. If the first byte is less than 253, it's the value itself. Otherwise, the next 2, 4, or 8 bytes contain the actual value, depending on the prefix. This is crucial for correctly parsing transaction structure.
I also need to handle variable-length byte arrays (varslices) which are common in Bitcoin transactions. These start with a varint indicating the length, followed by that many bytes of data. Similarly, hash values in Bitcoin are stored in little-endian but typically used in big-endian, so I'll need conversion functions like reverse-buff32.
Now for the core transaction parsing. The parse-tx function needs to read a version, inputs, outputs, and locktime. For SegWit transactions, parse-wtx will additionally need to handle witness data. Both functions will build upon our basic readers, following Bitcoin's serialization format. I should make sure to check that we consume exactly the right amount of data to prevent malicious truncated transactions.
For block header parsing, I'll need the parse-block-header function to extract the version, parent hash, merkle root, timestamp, difficulty bits, and nonce. This will be essential for verifying that a transaction is included in a specific block.
Wait, I also need to think about merkle proof verification. A merkle proof includes a path and a set of intermediate hashes. To verify it, I need to hash pairs of nodes walking up the tree until I reach the merkle root. If the calculated root matches the expected one from the block header, the transaction is in the block. I'll implement this with a fold operation that processes each level of the tree.
For debugging and testing purposes, I might want to include a mechanism to mock blockchain data that would normally come from the underlying blockchain. This can be done with a map to store mock header hashes.
Next, I need to consider SegWit-specific verification. SegWit transactions include a commitment to witness data in a special output. I'll need functions to identify and validate this commitment. The was-segwit-tx-mined-compact function will need to verify both the transaction's inclusion in the block and the witness commitment.
Okay, let's think about the overall flow of verification. First, we verify that the provided block header matches the expected height. Then we check that the transaction's merkle proof is valid against the block's merkle root. For SegWit transactions, we additionally verify the witness commitment.
For the final API, I want functions that encapsulate all this logic in a user-friendly way. was-tx-mined-compact will handle regular transactions, while was-segwit-tx-mined-compact will handle SegWit transactions.
I should be careful about buffer size limits throughout. Clarity has strict limitations on data sizes, so I need to ensure all buffers (like scriptSig and scriptPubKey) have appropriate maximum lengths. This is reflected in the unwrap-panic and as-max-len? calls that appear frequently.
Finally, I need to think about the execution flow and error handling. Since Clarity is a non-Turing complete language, I need to ensure all operations are deterministic and all failure cases are handled properly. The try! and unwrap! operators will be used extensively to propagate errors up the call stack.
In summary, this contract needs to carefully parse Bitcoin transaction data, verify cryptographic proofs, and handle edge cases while working within Clarity's constraints. The resulting code is complex but provides a comprehensive verification mechanism for Bitcoin transactions that can be used within a Clarity-based blockchain.",";; title: stateless contract to verify bitcoin transaction

"Generate a Clarity smart contract for an NFT collection that implements the specified functionality, including defining a non-fungible token, managing token IDs, handling ownership, and enabling minting and transferring of tokens. Ensure the contract includes error constants for various scenarios such as unauthorized access or unsupported transactions, integrates a base URI for token metadata, and validates Bitcoin transaction mining status through an external clarity-bitcoin-lib-v5 library call. The mint function should increment the token ID, verify the sender is the contract owner, confirm the Bitcoin transaction was mined, and mint the token to the specified recipient. The transfer function must ensure only the token owner can initiate transfers and update ownership accordingly","First, I need to understand what I'm being asked to create. The prompt is asking for a Clarity smart contract that implements an NFT collection with specific functionality including token management, ownership handling, and minting/transfer capabilities. I'll need to think about how to structure this contract logically.
Let's start by implementing the NFT trait. In Clarity, traits allow contracts to implement standard interfaces, and for NFTs there's likely a standard trait to follow. I'll need to implement the nft-trait from a well-known library to ensure my contract follows standard NFT practices.
I'll need to define some key constants, particularly for error handling. Wait, I should think about what error scenarios might occur in an NFT contract: unauthorized access when someone other than the owner tries to mint, token ownership issues during transfers, and possibly Bitcoin transaction validation failures since the requirement mentions clarity-bitcoin-lib-v5.
Okay, for state management, I need variables to track important information. I'll need a non-fungible token definition, a way to track the last token ID used, and a base URI for metadata. The base URI will likely follow a pattern where the token ID can be inserted to create unique URIs for each token.
For the core functionality, I need to implement several public functions. The mint function seems complex - it needs to increment the token ID, verify the sender is the contract owner, validate a Bitcoin transaction was mined (using an external library), and then mint the token to a recipient. This suggests the NFT minting is tied to Bitcoin transactions in some way.
Then I need a transfer function that only allows the current token owner to transfer their NFTs to others. This is a standard NFT capability but requires careful ownership verification.
I should also include read-only functions for querying information about the NFTs, such as getting the token URI or checking who owns a particular token ID.
Let's see, for the Bitcoin transaction verification, I'll need to use that external library mentioned in the prompt. This suggests the contract might be designed for a system where NFT minting is triggered by or validated against Bitcoin blockchain events, which is an interesting cross-chain application.
The mint function will be the most complex part, as it needs to handle the token ID incrementing, verify the sender is the contract owner, validate Bitcoin transactions, and perform the actual minting. I might use a ""let"" expression to organize this logic clearly.
Wait, I need to make sure error handling is robust. Each function should validate preconditions before executing its core logic, and return appropriate error constants when those validations fail.
For the transfer function, I need to verify that the sender attempting the transfer is actually the current owner of the token being transferred. This prevents unauthorized transfers.
Then I need to think about how to organize the return values. Clarity functions typically return responses with either success values or error codes, so I'll need to structure my functions to handle both cases appropriately.
Okay, I think with all these considerations, I can create a comprehensive NFT contract that meets the requirements while providing appropriate error handling and security measures. The contract will define a non-fungible token, manage token IDs sequentially, handle ownership through the built-in NFT capabilities, enable minting with Bitcoin transaction validation, and allow secure transfers between users.",";;title: btc-tx-enabled-nft

"Generate a Clarity smart contract for a fungible token that adheres to the SIP-010 standard, ensuring it includes all necessary functions and constants as described: implement the SIP-010 trait, define a fungible token named 'count-token', include error constants for owner-only actions and non-token owners, set the contract owner as the transaction sender, define a mutable TOKEN-URI variable with an initial value, and specify constants for the token's name, symbol, and decimals. Include read-only functions to retrieve the balance of a given principal, the total supply of the token, the token's name, symbol, decimals, and URI. Add public functions to update the token URI if the caller is the contract owner, mint tokens with a fixed amount to the sender, burn tokens from the sender's balance or STX if no tokens exist, and transfer tokens between principals with an optional memo field while enforcing ownership checks.","I'll generate a detailed Chain-of-Thought explaining the reasoning process for creating this Clarity smart contract based on the requirements.
First, let me understand what I'm being asked to create: a fungible token that follows the SIP-010 standard. This is essentially the Stacks blockchain equivalent of Ethereum's ERC-20 token standard. I need to make sure this contract fully implements the required interface and includes all the specified functionality.
I'll start by implementing the SIP-010 trait, which is the interface our token needs to adhere to. This is done with the impl-trait declaration that references the standard trait definition. The trait path 'SP3FBR2AGK5H9QBDH3EEN6DF8EK8JY7RX8QJ5SVTE.sip-010-trait-ft-standard.sip-010-trait' points to the official SIP-010 trait definition on the Stacks blockchain.
Next, I need to define the actual fungible token. Since the requirement specifies naming it 'count-token', I'll use the define-fungible-token command with that name. This creates the basic token type that will be managed by our contract.
Let's see, I need error constants for owner-only actions and non-token owners. I'll define these as ERR_OWNER_ONLY with code u100 and ERR_NOT_TOKEN_OWNER with code u101. These will be used throughout the contract when validating permissions.
The contract owner should be set as the transaction sender. I'll define CONTRACT_OWNER as a constant with the value tx-sender, which captures whoever deploys the contract.
For the token metadata, I need to include a mutable TOKEN-URI variable. This should be modifiable later, so I'll use define-data-var to create a mutable variable. Since URIs might be empty, I'll make it an optional string type with a maximum length of 256 characters and initialize it with a sample URI.
Then I'll define the token's basic properties as constants: TOKEN_NAME as ""Count Token"", TOKEN_SYMBOL as ""COUNT"", and apparently TOKEN_DECIMALS (which seems to be referenced later but not defined in the snippet shown).
Okay, now for the read-only functions. The SIP-010 trait requires several standard getters. I'll implement: get-balance to check a principal's token balance, get-total-supply to return the total token supply, get-name to return the token name, get-symbol to return the token symbol, get-decimals to return the decimal places, get-token-uri to return the token's URI
For public functions, the requirements mention: A function to update the token URI (owner-only), A minting function, A burning function, A transfer function with memo field
For the URI update function, I'll create set-token-uri that validates the caller is the contract owner before updating the TOKEN-URI variable and emitting a notification of the change.
The mint function seems to be restricted to the .counter contract, not just the contract owner. This might be a specific design requirement where tokens are only minted through interaction with another contract.
Similarly, the burn function also checks if the caller is the .counter contract. Interestingly, it has a fallback to burn STX (the native token) if the user doesn't have enough COUNT tokens to burn, which is an unusual but potentially useful feature.
Finally, the transfer function needs to implement the SIP-010 transfer requirements plus handle an optional memo. The function verifies the sender is authorized, performs the token transfer, and prints the memo if provided.
Wait, I should double-check the permission checks in the transfer function. It seems to allow either the tx-sender or the contract-caller to be the sender, which provides flexibility but must be handled carefully to maintain security.
In summary, this contract fully implements the SIP-010 trait for a fungible token named ""Count Token"" with the specialized functionality to integrate with a counter contract for minting and burning. The contract includes all required read functions for token information and the necessary public functions for managing the token, with appropriate permission checks throughout.",";;title:count-token

"I need a Clarity smart contract that implements a payment channel system for off-chain transactions in STX and SIP-010 tokens, including functionalities like opening, closing, disputing, and finalizing channels, signature verification, nonce management, and payout mechanisms, ensuring it adheres to best practices for security and efficiency within the Stacks ecosystem.","First, I need to understand what a payment channel system is and how it would work within the Stacks ecosystem. Payment channels allow for off-chain transactions between parties, reducing blockchain congestion and fees while maintaining security. The basic workflow involves: Opening a channel between two parties with initial deposits, Conducting multiple off-chain transactions by exchanging signed messages, Eventually closing the channel and settling the final balances on-chain, Let's see, the contract needs to implement several key functionalities including opening channels, updating channel states, disputing transactions, and closing channels. I'll need to ensure proper security with signature verification.

For state management, I'll need to track channel information like participants, balances, expiration times, and a nonce to prevent replay attacks. I'll start by defining constants, error codes, and data structures.

The contract will need to support both STX (native token) and SIP-010 fungible tokens, so I'll use a trait to handle this flexibility. This means I need to implement token-agnostic functions.

Okay, for channel identification, I should create a deterministic way to reference channels between two parties. Since the order of participants shouldn't matter, I'll sort the principals to create a consistent key.

Wait, I need to think about security. Channel operations must be authorized by valid signatures from the parties involved. I'll implement structured data signing following SIP-018 standard to prevent signature replay attacks across different contracts.

For the channel lifecycle, I'll need functions to: Initialize the contract and set supported tokens, Fund/open channels, Close channels cooperatively, with both parties' signatures), Handle disputes with timelock mechanisms, Allow unilateral closures when needed, Manage deposits/withdrawals, during channel lifetime, I might need an agent system too, allowing users to delegate transaction execution to third parties without compromising security.

For dispute resolution, I should implement a challenge period where the counterparty can submit a more recent channel state. This prevents fraud by giving both parties time to respond.

The signature verification is particularly important. Each update to channel state must be signed by both parties. The signatures will need to cover all relevant data including balances, nonce, action type, and any conditional execution parameters.

Let me think about edge cases. What if a participant becomes unresponsive? I need a force-close mechanism with a timeout period. What about invalid state transitions? I'll need proper validation checks.

For payment execution, the contract must hold funds in escrow and distribute them correctly when channels close. This requires careful handling of token transfers.

Wait, I should also consider hash time-locked contracts (HTLCs) for conditional payments, which would enable more complex use cases like atomic swaps.

The nonce management is critical - each update must have a higher nonce than previous ones to ensure outdated states can't be used.

For data structures, I'll use maps to store channel information with composite keys containing participant addresses and token information.

Maybe I should add some utility functions to make the code more readable and maintainable, separating business logic from technical operations like signature verification.

Thinking about error handling, I'll define specific error constants to improve debugging and user experience.

Okay, then for security, I need to ensure funds can't be stolen - only transferred according to agreed-upon state updates with valid signatures. The contract must validate that the sum of balances remains consistent during updates.

I should also implement events (via print statements in Clarity) to allow monitoring of channel operations off-chain.

Might be good to allow withdrawals during channel lifetime to improve capital efficiency.

Overall, the contract needs to balance security, efficiency, and usability while implementing all the core payment channel functionalities. The resulting code should provide a robust foundation for off-chain transactions in the Stacks ecosystem.",";; title: stackflow

"please generate a Clarity smart contract that implements a subnet system with functionalities for managing miners, registering new fungible and non-fungible token contracts, committing blocks with withdrawal roots, handling deposits and withdrawals of STX, fungible tokens, and non-fungible tokens while ensuring proper validation through Merkle proofs, and performing safe transfers or minting of assets as needed, based on the structure and logic demonstrated in the provided code snippet.","First, I need to understand what a subnet system is in the context of blockchain. A subnet is essentially a secondary blockchain network that operates alongside a main chain. It allows for specialized transaction processing and scaling. For this implementation, I'll need to create a contract that manages asset transfers between the main chain (L1) and the subnet (L2).
Let me start by defining the error constants. These are important for providing meaningful feedback when operations fail. I'll need constants for common error cases like block commits, invalid miners, failed transfers, and validation issues. These will make debugging easier and improve the user experience by providing specific error messages.
Next, I need to set up the data structures. I'll need maps to track committed blocks, withdrawal roots, and processed withdrawals. These are essential for maintaining the state of the subnet and preventing double-spending. I'll also need a variable to track the authorized miner who can commit blocks and register contracts.
For contract interoperability, I'll need to use traits to interact with different token standards. I'll need traits for NFTs, fungible tokens, and a custom trait for minting tokens from the subnet. This allows the contract to interact with various token contracts in a standardized way.
The miner management is crucial for security. I'll implement a function to update the miner, but only the current miner should be allowed to set a new one. This maintains the security of the subnet by ensuring only authorized parties can commit blocks.
For asset registration, I'll need functions to register both fungible and non-fungible token contracts. This creates a mapping between L1 contracts and their L2 counterparts. The registration should only be allowed by the authorized miner.
Wait, I need to implement block commitment functionality. This is how the subnet's state is anchored to the main chain. Each block commitment should include a withdrawal root which is a Merkle root of all withdrawals included in that block. I'll need to validate that the block hasn't been committed before and that the miner is authorized.
Now for the core asset management functions. I'll start with NFT deposits and withdrawals. For deposits, users transfer their NFTs to the contract, which records the deposit event. For withdrawals, the contract needs to validate a Merkle proof against the committed withdrawal root, then transfer the NFT to the recipient.
Let's see, I need to handle cases where the contract might need to mint new NFTs rather than just transfer existing ones. This could happen if an NFT was created on the subnet but needs to be withdrawn to the main chain. I'll implement logic to check if the contract owns the NFT and mint it if necessary.
For fungible tokens, the logic is similar but with an additional consideration for amounts. I need to handle deposits where users transfer tokens to the contract, and withdrawals where the contract validates a Merkle proof and then transfers tokens back to users. Like with NFTs, I might need to mint tokens if the contract doesn't have enough balance.
The STX token (native token) needs special handling since it's not a contract. I'll implement dedicated functions for STX deposits and withdrawals, with similar validation logic but using the built-in stx-transfer? function instead of contract calls.
Okay, now I need to implement the Merkle proof validation. This is critical for security as it proves that a withdrawal was included in a committed block. I'll need functions to hash withdrawal data consistently, verify the Merkle path, and track processed withdrawals to prevent double-spending.
For the leaf hashing functions, I need to create distinct formats for STX, NFT, and FT withdrawals. These create unique identifiers for each withdrawal that can be included in the Merkle tree.
Then, I'll implement the hash verification logic that walks up the Merkle tree using the provided sibling hashes. This should reconstruct the root hash which can be compared against the committed withdrawal root.
Finally, I need a function to mark withdrawals as processed once they're successfully executed. This prevents the same withdrawal from being processed multiple times.
The implementation needs to be careful about error handling throughout. Each operation should validate the inputs and state before proceeding, and provide specific error codes when things go wrong. I also need to ensure the contract properly emits events for important operations like deposits and withdrawals to make them observable off-chain.
This comprehensive contract design should satisfy all the requirements for a subnet system with proper asset management and security controls.",";;title: subnet

"Generate a Clarity smart contract for a non-fungible token (NFT) that implements the nft-trait interface, defines a token called funny-dog with a unique identifier of type uint, and includes functionality for minting new tokens, transferring ownership, and retrieving metadata such as the token URI and owner. Ensure the contract enforces ownership restrictions, prevents minting beyond a predefined collection limit, and uses a base URI template for token metadata. Include error handling for unauthorized actions, invalid transfers, and exceeding the collection size","Chain-of-Thought for Designing the Funny-Dog NFT Contract
First, I need to understand what I'm being asked to build: a Clarity smart contract for an NFT collection called ""funny-dog"" that implements the standard NFT trait interface. Let's break down the requirements and think about how to structure this.
I'll start by implementing the nft-trait interface since this is a standard requirement for NFT contracts in Clarity. This ensures my contract will be compatible with other applications in the Stacks ecosystem. The trait implementation should be the first line of the contract.
Next, I need to define the non-fungible token itself. Since we're creating a token called ""funny-dog"" with a unique identifier of type uint, I'll use the define-non-fungible-token command. This establishes the token domain and specifies that each token will be identified by an unsigned integer.
Wait, I need to track the last minted token ID to ensure uniqueness when minting new tokens. A data variable seems appropriate for this, starting at 0 since we haven't minted any tokens yet.
Okay, now I should consider ownership and permissions. The contract creator should have special privileges, like the ability to mint new tokens. I'll define a constant to store the contract owner's address (captured during contract deployment as tx-sender).
For robust error handling, I should define constants for different error types. I'll need errors for when non-owners attempt privileged operations, when users try to transfer tokens they don't own, and when someone tries to mint beyond our collection limit.
The requirement mentions metadata retrieval with a base URI template. I should store this as a data variable, allowing it to potentially be updated later. The URI will include a placeholder for the token ID.
Let's move on to core functionality. I need read-only functions to query information about tokens: the last token ID, a token's URI, and a token's owner. These are straightforward implementations using the appropriate getter functions.
For ownership transfers, I need a public function that checks if the sender is the current owner before allowing the transfer. This prevents unauthorized transfers and is a critical security feature.
Finally, I need a minting function that creates new tokens. This should verify the minter is the contract owner, check that we haven't exceeded the collection limit, perform the minting operation, update our token counter, and return the new token ID.
Wait, I notice I'm missing the COLLECTION_LIMIT constant. This should be defined to cap the total number of tokens that can be minted, as specified in the requirements.
The metadata function uses a base URI template, but I might want to enhance this to actually replace the {id} placeholder with the actual token ID. However, for a basic implementation, returning the template string provides the necessary information.
Let me think about additional security considerations... I should ensure that only the current owner can transfer a token, which I've done with the assertion in the transfer function. The mint function should restrict minting privileges to the contract owner, which I've also included.
This design approach satisfies all the requirements: implementing the nft-trait interface, defining a token with uint identifiers, providing minting, transfer, and metadata functionality, and including appropriate error handling and ownership restrictions.",";;title: funny dog

"Generate a Clarity smart contract for an NFT marketplace that allows users to list NFTs for sale, cancel listings, and fulfill listings using either STX or fungible tokens. The contract should include error handling for scenarios like expired listings, unauthorized actions, and asset mismatches. Implement whitelisting for asset contracts, ensure proper validation of listing details, and define functions for transferring NFTs and fungible tokens securely. Focus on creating a robust and efficient implementation without including deployment or testing components.""




","First, I need to analyze what an NFT marketplace requires at its core. The fundamental operations would be listing items for sale, canceling listings, and allowing buyers to purchase items. Since we need to support both STX (native Stacks token) and other fungible tokens as payment methods, I'll need to implement separate fulfillment functions for each.
Let's start by defining the necessary traits. I'll need to use the NFT trait for handling non-fungible tokens and the FT trait for fungible tokens. This allows our contract to interact with any NFT or FT that conforms to these standard interfaces without knowing their specific implementation details.
Next, I should establish the state management for our marketplace. A map to store listings would be essential, where each listing needs to contain information about the seller (maker), potential specific buyer (taker), token ID, NFT contract, expiration time, price, and payment asset contract. I'll need a nonce counter to generate unique listing IDs.
I'll also need a way to whitelist asset contracts to ensure only verified contracts can be used in the marketplace. This helps prevent scams and adds a layer of security.
Then, I should think about error handling. There are various scenarios where operations might fail: expired listings, unauthorized actions, asset mismatches, etc. I'll define constants for these error codes to make the contract more readable and maintainable.
For the listing functionality, the contract needs to verify that the NFT asset is whitelisted, the price is greater than zero, and the payment asset (if specified) is whitelisted. After validation, the NFT should be transferred to the contract as escrow until the listing is fulfilled or canceled.
Wait, I should also implement helper functions for transferring NFTs and FTs. These abstractions will make the main functions cleaner and less error-prone.
The cancellation function needs to verify that the caller is the maker of the listing and that the NFT contract matches. If everything checks out, the listing is removed, and the NFT is returned to the maker.
For fulfillment, I need separate functions for STX and FT payments. Both should verify that the listing exists, the caller isn't the maker, the listing hasn't expired, and the asset contracts match. If a specific taker is set, only that principal can fulfill the listing. After validation, the NFT is transferred to the buyer, and the payment is sent to the seller.
Okay, let me think about additional security considerations. The contract should ensure that actions are performed by authorized parties. For example, only the contract owner should be able to modify the whitelist, and only the maker of a listing can cancel it.
Let's see, I should also ensure that when the contract transfers assets, it does so safely using appropriate error handling. The contract should verify all conditions before making any transfers to prevent partial executions that could lead to asset loss.
I might need to implement the as-contract function when the contract needs to transfer assets it holds. This ensures the contract acts as the sender for these operations.
Finally, the functions that read state without modifying it should be defined as read-only to optimize gas costs. This includes functions like getting listing details or checking if an asset is whitelisted.
Actually, I should also provide proper documentation and naming conventions to make the contract more maintainable. This is especially important for complex contracts like an NFT marketplace.
Therefore, my implementation would include defining relevant traits, creating data structures for listings and whitelisting, implementing secure transfer functions, and providing comprehensive error handling. The contract would support listing assets with optional specific takers, expiration times, and different payment methods. It would ensure that all operations are secure, validated, and performed by authorized parties.",";;title: nft-marketplace

"Generate a Clarity smart contract for a decentralized marketplace called 'tiny-market' that allows users to list, cancel, and fulfill NFT asset trades. The contract should include functionality for whitelisting asset contracts, managing listings with details like maker, taker, token ID, expiry, and price, and enforcing rules such as expiration checks, price validation, and payment asset restrictions. It should support trading using STX or fungible tokens (FTs), enforce proper permissions for actions like canceling or fulfilling listings, and validate asset and payment contract matches. Ensure the use of traits for NFT and FT standards, implement error handling for common issues like unauthorized access or expired listings, and provide helper functions for transferring assets securely.","First, we need to design a smart contract that enables users to list, cancel, and fulfill NFT trades in a decentralized marketplace. The contract must support trading via STX or fungible tokens (FTs) while ensuring security through proper validations and error handling. Given this, we must incorporate mechanisms to enforce expiration checks, price validation, and contract whitelisting for NFTs and payment assets.

Wait, before diving into the core functionality, we must define and utilize traits for NFTs and FTs, ensuring compatibility with Clarity's standards. By using use-trait, we allow our contract to interact with external NFT and FT implementations while enforcing adherence to the required transfer functions. Next, we establish a contract-owner to manage administrative functions like asset contract whitelisting.

Let’s see, a core aspect of the marketplace is maintaining listings. We define a listings map where each listing is uniquely identified by an integer key. Each entry should store critical details: the maker (who lists the asset), an optional taker (if a specific buyer is required), token ID, NFT contract address, expiry timestamp, price, and an optional payment asset contract. To track unique listings, we maintain a listing-nonce variable, ensuring that each listing receives a unique ID. Additionally, to prevent unauthorized assets from being traded, we introduce a whitelisted-asset-contracts map, allowing only approved contracts to be used for trading.

Okay, then we need a function to manage contract whitelisting. A read-only function is-whitelisted determines if a given contract is allowed for trading. Meanwhile, set-whitelisted lets the contract owner modify this whitelist, ensuring only authorized contracts can participate in the marketplace. To support asset transfers, we define helper functions: transfer-nft and transfer-ft, which delegate transfer logic to the respective asset contracts via contract-call?, enforcing security and compatibility.

Maybe the most critical functionality is list-asset. This function allows a user to list an NFT for trade. First, we ensure the NFT contract is whitelisted. Then, we validate that the expiry timestamp is in the future and that the price is greater than zero. If a payment asset is specified, it must also be whitelisted. After these checks, we transfer the NFT to the contract's custody, ensuring that the seller cannot reclaim or modify the asset before trade completion. Finally, we store the listing details and increment listing-nonce for future listings.

Next, for retrieval purposes, we define get-listing, a simple read-only function that returns a listing's details given its ID. This function enables users to inspect available listings before proceeding with transactions. Now, let’s address cancellations. The cancel-listing function allows the maker to remove a listing before it is fulfilled. First, we verify that the listing exists and that the caller is the maker. Then, we check that the stored NFT contract matches the provided contract to prevent mismatches. If all checks pass, we delete the listing from storage and return the NFT to its original owner.

Might there be any complications in fulfilling listings? Yes, we must enforce strict validation to prevent unauthorized transactions. The assert-can-fulfil function ensures that the buyer is not the same as the maker, the taker (if specified) matches the caller, the listing has not expired, and the correct NFT and payment asset contracts are used. This function centralizes validation logic, reducing redundancy in fulfillment functions.

Finally, we implement two fulfillment functions: fulfil-listing-stx and fulfil-listing-ft. The former is used when the buyer pays in STX, while the latter is used for FT payments. Both follow a structured process: they retrieve the listing, validate fulfillment conditions, transfer the NFT to the buyer, transfer the payment to the seller, and remove the listing upon successful execution. The structured use of try! ensures that if any step fails, the entire transaction is reverted, preventing asset loss or unintended transfers.

In conclusion, this contract is designed to facilitate secure and flexible NFT trading while enforcing strict validation to prevent fraud and errors. It achieves this through robust state management, proper whitelisting mechanisms, and secure asset transfer logic.",";; title:tiny-market

"Develop a comprehensive Clarity smart contract for the Stacks blockchain that facilitates decentralized lending.  Users should be able to deposit STX, borrow against their deposits, and earn yield.  The contract should manage user deposits and balances, provide loan functionality with block-height based interest, and distribute the yield to depositors.  The lending parameters include a 50% loan-to-value limit and a 10% interest rate.  The contract must include robust error handling and provide functions to query user balances and loan amounts.  Implement secure STX transfers using contract-based patterns.  Include detailed comments explaining each element.","I'll outline the thought process for creating a Clarity smart contract for a Stacks-based lending protocol.  The design will follow a step-by-step approach to cover the required features.

First, identify the core components: deposit management, borrowing, loan operations, and yield distribution, all utilizing STX. 

Next, data structures are needed. Maps are essential.  A map will link user addresses to their STX deposit amounts. Another map connects borrowers to their outstanding loan amounts and the block height of their last interaction (for interest). 

Global variables are required: total deposits (for yield calculation), the accumulated pool-reserve for interest, and a fixed loan interest rate (10%). 

Error conditions are defined to report failures, improving contract usability and security.

Functional implementation begins. The `deposit` function allows STX deposits using `stx-transfer?`, updates the user's deposit in the map, and increments the total deposits.  `let` bindings and map operations are used here for safe state management. 

`borrow` enforces a 50% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio.  The borrowing limit is half the user's deposit.  Prior to lending, accrued interest on existing loans is calculated using the private `calculate-accrued-interest` function. The loan record gets updated. 

`repay` calculates the total due, including accrued interest.  It prevents overpayment. The repayment moves STX to the contract, updating the loan record.  The interest portion goes to the pool-reserve for yield distribution.

`claim-yield` distributes accumulated interest to depositors, calculated proportionally based on their deposit share. Yield is distributed in proportion to the user's deposit relative to the total deposits (using the pool-reserve).

Read-only functions (`get-balance-by-sender`, `get-balance`, `get-amount-owed`) enable queries of balances and outstanding obligations without modifying contract state.

Finally, `calculate-accrued-interest` computes interest based on block height since the last interaction.  The interest calculation is based on the 10% rate and the number of elapsed blocks, and applies to the loan principal.

Review: The `borrow` function had an issue. The new-loan amount computation seems incorrect as it might not consider the current loan and accrued interest.

In summary, the contract must have robust deposit management functions with functions for borrowing against collateral, implementing dynamic interest calculation, proper yield distributions, setting a loan-to-value limit, and comprehensive error handling. The read-only queries are necessary for the functionality expected.",";; Define the contract's data variables

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for the Stacks blockchain, operating as a straightforward NFT marketplace. Allow users to put NFTs up for sale with settings such as token ID, end date, cost, payment method (STX or SIP010 tokens), and an optional intended buyer. Include features to approve contracts, list assets, withdraw listings, and complete purchases using both STX and fungible tokens. Ensure the contract handles errors, implements security measures, and uses the standard NFT and fungible token traits.","The core function is to create an NFT marketplace on Stacks using Clarity, allowing users to list NFTs with properties like token ID, expiry, price, payment asset type (STX/SIP010), and optional target buyer. The contract should also manage a whitelist of approved contracts and allow assets listing, removal, buying with STX and fungible tokens. Clarity's safety features are critical, including its handling of errors and the whitelisting feature. State storage uses a map ID to listing parameters. Unique IDs are created using a variable nonce, that is incremented with each new listing and ensures each listing has a unique identifier. The whitelisting mechanism controls which contracts interact with the marketplace. Error handling is designed with different specific codes for different scenarios, improving debugging and user feedback. The list-asset function validates whitelist membership, expiration, and price and NFT contract approval, then transferring the NFT to the marketplace. The get-listing function simply retrieves listing info by ID. cancel-listing requires the original maker's authorization, verification, then the NFT returns to the maker and the listing is removed. Fulfill-purchase is split into STX/FT versions. Both functions validate that the buyer isn't the maker, the intended buyer matches, listing is not expired, and asset contracts match. Helper functions transfer-nft, and transfer-ft streamline token transfers. The contract uses as-contract context for token transfers for security. It uses stx-transfer? for STX and transfer-ft for fungible tokens, making the exchange. It doesn't include a marketplace commission to keep it minimal. The transaction process validates conditions, transfers the NFT to the buyer, processes payment, and removes the listing. The contract handles expired listings, unauthorized cancellations, and asset contract issues providing good error handling.",";; A tiny NFT marketplace that allows users to list NFT for sale. They can specify the following:
;; - The NFT token to sell.
;; - Listing expiry in block height.
;; - The payment asset, either STX or a SIP010 fungible token.
;; - The NFT price in said payment asset.
;; - An optional intended taker. If set, only that principal will be able to fulfil the listing.

"Develop a Stacks Blockchain Clarity smart contract for the SIP-009 NFT standard. The contract should include a named ""Your-NFT-Name"" non-fungible token, track the most recently minted token ID, and restrict the collection to 1000 tokens. Establish constants for the contract's creator (using the transaction sender), pertinent error codes for ownership issues and collection limits, along with a configurable base URI for token metadata. Implement all compulsory SIP-009 functions: get-last-token-id, get-token-uri, get-owner, and a sender-validated transfer function. Also, create a mint function exclusively accessible to the contract owner, which adheres to the collection limit, mints tokens to a designated recipient, increments the token ID, and returns the new token ID. Incorporate thorough error management and assertions in all functions to ensure code security and proper functionality.","First, I need to program a Clarity smart contract for the Stacks blockchain adhering to the SIP-009 NFT standard. I should start by implementing the necessary trait from its specified location to ensure my contract meets the NFT standards. This establishes contract compliance with Stacks blockchain NFTs. Then, define the NFT itself. Using ""Your-NFT-Name"" as an adaptable placeholder, I need to specify that token IDs will be represented by unsigned integers, the common NFT format. Next, I need to track minted tokens using a counter that increments per mint. I'll set the last token ID to zero. Constants must be set up. The contract owner should be the deployer (tx-sender). Also, enforce the 1000-token collection limit. Define error codes for security like unauthorized function calls or exceeding the collection limit. Also, I need a base URI to store metadata for the tokens, and make it a string variable to point to the metadata for all tokens, and include a token ID placeholder. Implement SIP-009 functions: get-last-token-id, get-token-uri, get-owner, and a transfer function. Secure the transfer function by verifying token ownership using an assertion. The mint function requires safeguards. Calculate the new token ID by incrementing the last one. Check if the collection limit is reached. Restrict mint access to the contract owner. If all checks pass, mint the token, update the token ID counter, then return the token ID. All functions must return well-formatted responses. For read-only functions, the result will be wrapped in an (ok ...). For state-changing functions, use try! and asserts! for error propagation, and validation purposes, to improve robustness.",";; This contract implements the SIP-009 community-standard Non-Fungible Token trait

"Create a Clarity smart contract compatible with the Stacks Blockchain. This contract should represent a semi-fungible token compliant with SIP-013, incorporating both 'sip013-semi-fungible-token-trait' and 'sip013-transfer-many-trait' from the library located at 'SPDBEG5X8XD50SPM1JJH0E5CTXGDV5NJTKAKKR5V'. The design needs to encompass standard fungible token characteristics alongside a unique non-fungible token ID system, employing maps to manage supplies and balances. Essential functions should include those for single and batch transfers (with and without memos), supply tracking, balance inquiries, and owner-restricted minting. Furthermore, proper error management, access control, and event logging must be incorporated, while maintaining token ID ownership through the non-fungible token tagging system.","The prompt describes a contract that should implement the SIP-013 semi-fungible token standard. The code implements the traits 'sip013-semi-fungible-token-trait' and 'sip013-transfer-many-trait'. This means it focuses on a semi-FT rather than a SIP-009 NFT. The comparison of code's implementation versus question's requirements shows that the code is not implementing the features described in the question, such as the sequential NFT minting, collection limits, 'get-last-token-id'. The code does implement the storage structure through data maps, error handling with ownership and balance checks, sender verification, and SIP-013 functions.

"Develop a Stacks Clarity smart contract for a bridged stablecoin with SIP-10 compatibility, bridging features, administrative controls (ownership, minting allowances, pause, ban), configurable token metadata, precise decimals, core token functions (transfer, mint, burn), an extension interface for authorized contracts, comprehensive event emitting, initial pause state, and authorization checks.","The contract's structure utilizes traits: SIP-10 for token standards, and additional traits to enable bridging and extension abilities. Error handling is centralized using descriptive error codes with a consistent numbering scheme. State management uses data variables and maps. Metadata is stored in strings, token balances use the built-in fungible-token type, and maps are used for allowances and banned addresses. The contract employs an ownership system to authorize sensitive actions, and the token initially starts in a paused state. The minting system uses a dual-map approach for tracking allowances and usage. The SIP-10 implementation gives standard interface access for external contract interactions. Administrative functions consistently verify authorization, perform actions, emit events, and return success. An address banning system restricts token transfers. The extension system lets the token interact with authorized external contracts through a controlled interface. Error handling is detailed, with function validation and use of unwrap! and match expressions. The token implements memo support for transaction context tracking.",";; title: circle-usdce-token

"Design a Clarity smart contract for the Stacks blockchain that acts as a basic STX bank.

These methods should include a deliberately insecure option. The contract should also provide read-only access to account balances and administrative functions enabling the owner to withdraw from any account, as well including a time-delayed withdrawal option based on block height. The contract should be created as an educational tool, with detailed in-code comments explaining security practices, input validation, error management using constants, and showcasing Clarity's security features (assertions, conditional checks, etc.).","The prompt requires a STX banking smart contract on Stacks. The primary functionality is STX deposits and withdrawals, tracked account balances, and varied withdrawal implementations. The contract must include error handling, administrative controls, and a time-based unlock feature. The implementation should offer clear explanations and examples of security features and best/worst practices. The contract framework starts with defining error codes for consistent and predictable behavior, fulfilling the requirement to demonstrate ""proper error handling with constants."" The ""accounts"" map stores user balances, directly addressing the need to ""maintain a map of user accounts with their balances."" Deposits involve retrieving and updating account balances using `map-get?` along with STX transfer. The implementation includes comments about accepting unchecked data, with the STX transfer ensuring validity. Withdrawal implementations are key. The contract contains several withdrawal functions, one deliberately unsafe. The ""unsafe-withdrawal"" function allows potentially withdrawing more than the balance, demonstrating consequences of missing balance checks. Secure withdrawals are implemented through: (1) validating balance using assertions (2) using conditional logic for validation and (3) using a separate helping function for validation. Each implements the requirement to have ""multiple withdrawal implementations with varying security patterns."" A read-only function, `get-balance`, allows users to check their balance and satisfies the need for read-only function requirements. Administrative functions allow a designated owner to withdraw from any account, meeting the requirement that ""administrative functions allowing a bank owner to withdraw from any account."" The `take` function enforces access control using ownership checks. The ""take-after-time""  and `expiration-height` variables implement time-based withdrawals unlocked after a given block height, matching the requirement to have ""a time-based withdrawal feature that unlocks after a certain block height."" Code comments throughout provide clear explanations of security regarding: tainted input, warning notes, and assertions, fulfilling the educational aspects of designing secure Clarity code by clearly addressing the points in requirements. The contract demonstrates Clarity's features with conditional checks and annotations. Each function highlights aspects of Clarity programming, covering validation to trusted sender checks. The contract offers a comprehensive educational example for Stacks, encompassing error handling, security patterns, and administration.",";; bank

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for Stacks blockchain fundraising. This contract should accept donations in STX and sBTC, allowing campaign initialization with a funding target and duration. The duration should default to 30 days (Bitcoin blocks). The contract must track donations by donor, enable campaign cancellation and donor refunds (if cancelled), and permit the beneficiary to withdraw funds upon campaign completion. Implement robust error handling, getter functions for information retrieval, and authorization checks for all functions. Essential data points include total donations, campaign status, and individual contribution records.","The task is to create a fundraising contract for the Stacks blockchain. This contract needs data variables to store the campaign state (initialization status, cancellation status, beneficiary, timing, goal, and donations). These variables dictate how the contract behaves across transactions. 

Individual donation records need to track donor addresses with contribution amounts, requiring maps for storing STX and sBTC donations (using addresses as keys).  

Error handling is crucial via defined error constants (e.g., err-not-authorized, err-campaign-ended) for clearer error feedback.

The `initialize-campaign` function requires owner authorization, prevents double initialization, and configures campaign parameters with a default duration.

Campaign management involves a `cancel-campaign` function with authorization checks and prevents cancellation after funds are withdrawn.

Donation functions are needed for STX and sBTC; both must verify campaign state, check for campaign end, transfer funds, and update donor records.

Fund withdrawal uses a `withdraw` function with beneficiary authorization and ensures the campaign has ended before transferring STX and sBTC.

Refunds, triggered by campaign cancellation, return contributions to donors and clear donation records.

Getter functions provide read access for donation details, campaign metrics, and contract balance.

In summary, the implementation should manage the campaign lifecycle, handle donations, withdrawals, and refunds with proper authorization and state management.",";; Fundraising Campaign Contract

"Design a Clarity smart contract for Stacks that enables sBTC payment streams. This contract should allow users to create streams, replenish existing streams, and allow recipients to withdraw funds and senders to reclaim remaining funds. The contract must support stream parameter updates with signed consent, track stream properties (sender, recipient, balance, withdrawn amount, rate, and timeframe), and implement comprehensive error handling for common issues like unauthorized actions, invalid signatures, and non-existent streams. Provide helper functions to determine balances and block differences.","The objective is to create a Clarity contract for the Stacks blockchain which implements a payment streaming protocol. The primary functionality revolves around the controlled transfer of sBTC from a sender to a recipient over a specified block count. The core data structure will be a map to handle multiple payment streams based on unique stream IDs. Each stream record will encompass sender, recipient, total balance, withdrawn amount, payment rate, and start and end block parameters.

The contract needs a mechanism to generate unique identifiers for each stream, which is done by incrementing a 'latest-stream-id' variable upon each stream creation.

The central functionalities include 'stream-to,' 'refuel,' 'withdraw,' 'refund,' and 'update-details'. The 'stream-to' function creates a new stream by locking the initial sBTC balance from the sender, setting stream parameters, and returning a stream ID. This function uses 'contract-caller' to ensure funds originate from the stream creator.
The 'refuel' function lets the sender add more funds to an existing stream, confirming the sender's identity. It then transfers the additional sBTC and updates the stream balance.
To calculate the balance, 'calculate-block-delta' computes the difference between the current and the stream's start, and stop blocks, and the 'balance-of' functions use this to derive sender and recipient balances based on the payment rate and time elapsed.
The 'withdraw' function enables recipients to collect accumulated funds. It verifies recipient identity, calculates the available balance, updates the withdrawn amount, and transfers the sBTC. The 'refund' function allows senders to recover unused funds after a stream's conclusion, confirmed by checking the current block against the stop block.
For updating stream parameters, 'update-details' requires consent from both parties, validated via cryptographic signatures. Hash-stream and validate-signature functions are included.
Error handling is implemented using different error codes to handle scenarios like unauthorized access, invalid signatures, attempts to refund active streams, and non-existent stream IDs.
Some functions, such as 'balance-of' and 'calculate-block-delta,' are read-only to optimize gas usage. They act as helper functions internally and for external queries. Also, sBTC transfers use the token interface and contract calls.",";; payment-stream.clar

"Develop a Clarity smart contract, named ""timelocked-wallet"", for the Stacks blockchain. This contract should time-lock STX tokens until a specified block height. The contract owner should be able to lock tokens for a designated beneficiary, specifying the unlock block height. Implement functions to allow the current beneficiary to transfer their rights and to claim the tokens after the unlock height is reached. Include error handling to ensure owner-only access, prevent multiple locks, ensure the unlock height is in the future, validate token amounts, limit actions to authorized parties, and prevent premature withdrawals. The contract should initialize beneficiary and unlock height variables appropriately.","The task is to create a time-locked wallet smart contract in Clarity for the Stacks blockchain. This requires understanding principals, block heights, and Clarity syntax. The contract should have three main functions: lock, bestow, and claim. The lock function should be controlled by the owner and set the parameters for the lock. The bestow function allows transfer of rights, and the claim function allows the beneficiary to withdraw tokens after the unlock height is reached. First, the foundation is established, including explanatory comments and defining the contract owner (tx-sender). Next, error constants with unique codes are defined to handle different failure scenarios which is good practice. Then, data variables are created for beneficiary (optional principal, initially none) and unlock height (uint, initialized to zero). The 'lock' function validates that the sender is the owner, that there isn't an existing lock, that the unlock height is in the future, and that a positive token amount is specified, then transfers STX tokens from the sender to the contract, and sets the beneficiary/unlock height. The 'bestow' function asserted the transaction sender is the beneficiary, then updates the beneficiary. The 'claim' function checks the signer is the beneficiary and the current block height is after the unlock height, and then transfers all STX tokens from the contract to the beneficiary using as-contract and stx-get-balance. The code incorporates assertions utilizing the error constants, enabling clear error reporting. Therefore, the contract fulfills the requirements with consideration for security, functionality and maintainability, including edge case handling and Clarity best practices.",";; timelocked-wallet

"Create a Clarity smart contract for a Stacks blockchain fungible token named ""Clarity Coin"" (symbol ""CC"") that conforms to the SIP-010 standard. The token should have an unlimited supply, with only the contract owner authorized to mint new tokens. Include standard functions for transferring tokens (verifying the sender and allowing an optional memo) and implement all required read-only functions. Define error constants to handle unauthorized minting and invalid transfer attempts.","The task involves constructing a Clarity smart contract that adheres to the SIP-010 standard for a fungible token. First, the SIP-010 standard must be implemented by importing the SIP-010 trait. This is done by referencing the standard library at its stipulated location. Next, the contract owner needs to be established and access control implemented. This is achieved by setting the deployer as the owner and then implementing error codes to provide feedback on unauthorized or invalid actions. Error codes include `err-owner-only` for unauthorized minting, and `err-not-token-owner` for transfer failures. Then, define the fungible token 'clarity-coin' without a supply cap. Next, code the transfer function: the function ensures that the sender matches the transaction's origin using `asserts!`, which returns `err-not-token-owner` if there is a discrepancy. Then use `ft-transfer?` to process the actual token transfer while capturing any potential errors. Finally, handle the memo parameter conditionally by using a `match` statement. If a memo is provided, print it; otherwise, return a default value. Now implement the read-only functions: `get-name` will return ""Clarity Coin"". `get-symbol` will return ""CC"". `get-decimals` returns `u0`. `get-balance` uses `ft-get-balance` to get the balance for a principal. `get-total-supply` utilizes `ft-get-supply` to query the total supply. `get-token-uri` returns `none` because there isn't a URI specified in the requirements. After that, implement the mint function restricting it to the owner. This function checks if the caller is the contract owner, then mints tokens to the recipient using `ft-mint?`. This addresses the restricted minting requirement. All requirements are addressed; adhering to SIP-010, handling token transfers with sender verification, providing an optional memo parameter, implementing the required read-only functions, restricting minting to the owner, not having a maximum supply, and including appropriate error constants.","(impl-trait 'SP3FBR2AGK5H9QBDH3EEN6DF8EK8JY7RX8QJ5SVTE.sip-010-trait-ft-standard.sip-010-trait)

"Develop a Stacks-based Clarity smart contract that fetches real-time price information for a designated asset (e.g., BTC/USD) from the Pyth Network using the Stacks-Pyth Bridge, accompanied by detailed deployment and testing instructions.","I need to create a Clarity smart contract that obtains the real-time BTC/USD price from the Pyth Network using the Stacks-Pyth Bridge. Firstly, I must remember the connection process between Pyth and Stacks. Key components will be employed, incorporating traits and contracts such as pyth-storage-trait and pyth-decoder-trait, crucial for interaction with the Pyth Oracle. 

Initially, I'll define constants for the Pyth Oracle and storage contract addresses. The 32-byte BTC/USD feed ID (hexadecimal) is also essential. The contract will use `define-constant` for these, as illustrated in prior examples. 

The primary function will call the Pyth Oracle contract's `get-price` method, passing the feed ID and storage contract's address. I'll ensure the storage contract address is passed correctly, potentially by using `as-contract` if required, to change caller and context. This step is critical for proper data retrieval.  

Error management is vital. I will consider using `try!` and `unwrap!` to manage potential issues like incorrect storage addresses or outdated data, and determine whether a read-only function is suitable for this action. While the requirement focuses on data retrieval, the implementation of the Oracle’s `get-price` method will determine if a `define-public` function is needed. 

Given the task, the final code requires integration of the `pyth-storage-trait`, and necessary constants for oracle and storage contracts. The primary function will be `define-public`, and integrate error handling. If the `get-price` function requires specific handling via `as-contract`, this must be included. 

Finally, the contract must include in-line explanations describing each step and explain the different function interactions (governance checks, price retrieval, error handling). 

By structuring the contract with distinct modules, testing with tools like Clarinet will be simplified, resulting in a maintainable solution and a robust framework for retrieving the real-time BTC/USD price from the Pyth Network.",";; Pyth Oracle integration for BTC/USD price feed

"Develop a basic Clarity smart contract for a token named 'MyToken' (MTK) with a precision of 8 decimal places.

The contract must provide standard token operations. The plan is to define a fungible token and initialize a data variable for the overall supply. Also needed is a map to manage allowances, which influences the transfer mechanism. Private helper functions like 'allowance', 'increase-allowance' and 'decrease-allowance' will manage these permissions, with 'approve' calling 'increase-allowance'. Revocation needs to set the allowance to zero. The transfer-from function is required to decrement an allowance after tokens are transferred to ensure proper validation. Public facing functions such as 'get-balance' and 'get-total-supply' will make the token readily interactable. Metadata functions will return token details, including the IPFS stored URI. I also need to define a mint function which will initialize the token's balance by assigning tokens to the required addresses. Crucial is error handling with checks for non-negative amounts and valid allowances. The contract structure will use private internals and public interfaces for actions such as sending tokens, approval/revocation, and checking balances. The entire contract will be well documented to explain steps and secure the contract.","

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for a Stacks blockchain multisig wallet. This wallet should support owner modifications (adding, removing with threshold verification), transaction management (submission, confirmation, revocation), and cross-chain token swaps utilizing a magic bridge. The design must incorporate SIP-009/NFT and SIP-010/FT trait integrations for asset transfer capabilities. Include access control measures using permitted callers, validate transaction confirmations according to owner thresholds, and implement robust error handling for cases like ownership issues, invalid parameters and unauthorized actions. Code structure should feature clear comments, data maps for transaction and owner tracking, and helper functions dedicated for internal state updates. Additionally, ensure all crucial operations are protected by sender authentication and thorough parameter validation.","The prompt requires a Clarity contract for a multi-signature wallet, named Multisafe. First understanding, this wallet needs multiple signatures from authorized owners to approve and execute transactions. The contract uses traits for key features like safe behavior, NFTs, fungible tokens, plus a ""magic bridge"" interface for cross-chain operations. Important! The contract defines error codes to handle different problems, and uses itself (SELF) as a constant so it can act on its own behalf. It stores essential data: owner list, confirmation threshold, and a transaction counter (nonce). Owner management, allowing adds and removals, validates that the threshold is valid, within acceptable ranges given the number of owners. Transaction workflow = Submit → Confirm → Execute. Transactions are stored in a map; owners can submit, confirm or revoke their confirmations. Access control is key: most functions check if the sender is the contract itself or an authorized owner. Integrates with the ""magic bridge"" for cross-chain swaps. The initialization function is important, setting up owners and the threshold.

"Create a Stacks Clarity smart contract for a BTC/USD price oracle. This oracle should fetch both current and past prices from Pyth Network's pyth-storage-v3 contract using a price feed ID. Implement detailed error handling with specific error codes. The contract needs to use an sbtc-token contract to get its total supply, normalize values (using a divisor of 10^8), and calculate the total USD value of sBTC. The contract must handle errors from external calls, incorrect data, and calculations that overflow, while maintaining readability through read-only functions, type-safe verification, and explicit connections to external traits or contracts.","The proposed smart contract aims to securely and reliably access and process BTC/USD price data from the Pyth Network. Error handling is a key focus; for instance, `ERR_UNEXPECTED = u5000` defines a dedicated error code to manage unexpected failures and guarantee predictability. For real-time price updates, the `get-btc-price` function gets data from `pyth-storage-v3` using `contract-call?`. Success results in the price being returned within the `some` container, and errors cause `none` to be the result, thus ensuring that failures are appropriately managed and don't derail execution. To get historical data, `get-btc-price-at` first uses `get-stacks-block-info?` along with `unwrap-panic` to retrieve the block hash, thus guaranteeing its existence. The function then gets the price at that specific block, following the real-time data's error-prevention strategies. Interaction with the `sbtc-token` contract is enabled via the `get-sbtc-total-supply` function, which securely retrieves the total supply with `contract-call?`. The total USD value of sBTC is computed within the `get-sbtc-total-usd-value` function; It gets the total sBTC supply, normalized by division by `10^8`, does the same for the BTC price, and finds the product for the total USD value. Using `unwrap!` catches failed calls early to prevent unexpected errors. This is well-structured because it uses read-only functions for state safety and reuse. Dependencies on external contracts are clear, and the contract enforces type-safe operations to avoid overflows or invalid data. The design uses modular, composable calls, which contributes to maintainability while implementing robust functionality.","(define-constant ERR_UNEXPECTED (err u5000))

"Develop a Clarity smart contract designed to validate Bitcoin transactions. The contract should use merkle proof, block header data, and witness data (for SegWit transactions) to confirm transaction integrity.  Crucially, the contract must incorporate robust error handling across all operations and enforce stringent data length checks.","The objective is a Clarity contract capable of verifying Bitcoin transactions. This involves a deep understanding of Bitcoin's data structures and the limitations and features of Clarity. The contract needs to check transactions against their Merkle proofs and related block headers, while also correctly interpreting and validating SegWit witness data. 

First, the error codes need to be defined. Bitcoin transactions can fail for a multitude of reasons; each different failure scenario must be accounted for with custom error codes which helps in debugging and maintainability.  

Essential parsing functions are needed: fixed-size integers (read-uint8, read-uint16, read-uint32 and read-uint64), the correct parsing of variable-length integers (varints), particularly critical due to bitcoin's encoding scheme. Also, there must be variable-length byte array (varslices) parsers and functions to convert the byte order of hashes. 

Core transaction parsing is next, with `parse-tx` to read version, inputs, outputs, and locktime, and `parse-wtx` for SegWit's witness data. These will utilize the fundamental readers, following Bitcoin's serialization. Data bounds and well-formed transaction size checks are critical to avoid manipulation through truncated transactions, as are all buffer size limits. 

Block header parsing will include the `parse-block-header` function for critical fields needed for verification. Merkle proof validation methods must exist using intermediate hash calculation and root comparison using folds.  

For testing and demonstration purposes, a mechanism to mock blockchain data will be needed.

Consider SegWit transaction validation using special output detection and commitment verification. A function like `was-segwit-tx-mined-compact` will verify these aspects.

The contract must handle the overall verification flow, using a function, `was-tx-mined-compact`` will handle regular transactions and `was-segwit-tx-mined-compact` which will also incorporate SegWit. 

Buffer size limits will be checked throughout all the function calls. Clarity has strict data size constraints, which must be met by appropriately sized buffers (scriptSig, scriptPubKey, and others). Functions such as `unwrap` may signal errors. 

Error handling is paramount. Clarity's limitations have to be considered. All operations must be deterministic and fault-tolerant. The try and unwrap operators should be used to facilitate error propagation. 

This contract calls for parsing of Bitcoin transaction data, cryptographic proof validation, edge case treatment, and adherence to Clarity's principles. The resulting code is complex but useful for verifying transactions on a Clarity-based blockchain.",";; title: stateless contract to verify bitcoin transaction

"Create a Clarity smart contract representing an NFT collection. The contract should define the NFT, manage token identifiers, handle ownership, and include minting and transfer functionalities. Implement appropriate error constants for scenarios such as unauthorized actions and unsupported operations, and incorporate a base URI for token metadata.  Integrate Bitcoin transaction validation using an external library (clarity-bitcoin-lib-v5). The mint function must increment the token ID, verify the contract owner's identity, confirm mined Bitcoin transactions, and mint tokens to designated recipients. The transfer function should enforce ownership restrictions, enabling transfers only by the current token owners, with updated ownership records.","This task involves designing an NFT contract using Clarity, including standard NFT functionalities augmented with Bitcoin transaction validation. Initially, I must identify the elements of an NFT contract. Then, I will break this down into components like error definitions, NFT details, ownership mapping, and the minting/transfer methods. First: Define error codes for unauthorized access and other failures. Second: Include NFT traits from a Clarity library. Third: Define storage variables for NFT metadata and unique token IDs. Fourth: Implement a mint function: increment token ID, verify contract ownership, validate a Bitcoin transaction, and mint the NFT to the recipient.

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for the Stacks blockchain that enables off-chain payment channels using both STX and SIP-010 tokens.  The contract needs to facilitate channel creation, updates, disputes, and closure, while also incorporating signature verification, nonce management, and payout mechanisms, with a focus on security and efficient operation within the Stacks environment.","First, I need to grasp the concept of payment channels within the Stacks framework. These channels facilitate transactions off-chain to reduce on-chain activity, fees, and congestion while preserving security. The process involves:  Establishing a channel with initial deposits, executing numerous off-chain transactions with signed messages, and ultimately settling balances on the blockchain upon closure.  The contract should include functions for initiating, updating, disputing, and closing channels while ensuring security through signature verification. For state maintenance, I'll manage information like participants, balances, expiration times, and nonces to prevent replay attacks. I should begin by defining constants, error codes, and data structures. Given the need to support both STX and SIP-010 tokens, I'll employ a trait to ensure token-agnostic functions. I need a deterministic way to identify channels, and sorting the principals involved should produce consistent keys for each channel. Security is paramount; channel actions must be authorized by valid signatures. I'll implement standard structured data signing (SIP-018) to prevent replay attacks across different contracts. The channel's lifecycle necessitates functions to: Initialize the contract and set up supported tokens, Open/fund channels, Close channels cooperatively, Handle disputes with timelock mechanisms, Allow unilateral closures when necessary, and Manage deposits/withdrawals during channel operation. I could also use an agent system to allow users to delegate tasks.  For dispute resolution, a challenge period should be implemented, enabling the counterparty to submit the most recent channel state to prevent fraud by giving both parties time to respond. Signature verification is critical.  Each state update must be signed by both parties, ensuring all relevant data, including balances, nonce, action type, and conditional execution parameters, are covered.  Considering edge cases, I'll include a force-close mechanism with a timeout period for unresponsive participants and thorough state transition validations.   The contract must hold funds in escrow and distribute them correctly upon channel closure. Hash time-locked contracts (HTLCs) could also be used for conditional payments, facilitating complex use cases like atomic swaps.  Nonce management is crucial, with each update requiring a higher nonce than the previous ones. I'll employ maps with composite keys, including participant addresses and token details, for data structures.  Utility functions could improve code readability and maintainability by decoupling business logic from operations like signature verification.  Specific error constants should be defined to aid debugging, including print statements for events, thus enabling off-chain monitoring of channel operations. To improve capital efficiency, I may allow withdrawals during the channel's lifecycle.  The ultimate goal is to balance security, efficiency, and usability, creating a secure and robust foundation for off-chain transactions in the Stacks ecosystem.",";; title: stackflow

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for a subnet system with miner management, asset registration (fungible and non-fungible tokens), STX, fungible and non-fungible token deposits/withdrawals, Merkle proof-based validation, and safe asset transfers/minting, mirroring the features and logic of a given code example.","I will create a Clarity smart contract for a subnet system. First, I'll define error constants. Then, I'll implement data structures for committed blocks, withdrawal roots, and processed withdrawals, along with a variable to track the authorized miner. I will also use traits for interoperability with NFT and fungible token contracts. The security will be maintained through miner management functions. Then, I'll create functions to register fungible and non-fungible token contracts, followed by block commitment with withdrawal roots. Asset management will include deposit and withdrawal functions for NFTs, FTs, and STX, along with handling minting, when existing assets can't be transferred. Implementation of Merkle proof validation will be done through hashing, path verification, and tracking processed withdrawals. The leaf hashing will contain unique formats for STX, NFT, and FT withdrawals. Comprehensive error handling and event emitting will be critical. The aim is to design a contract fulfilling subnet system requirements with asset handling and strong security measures.",";;title: subnet

"Create a Clarity smart contract for an NFT named 'funny-dog'. This contract should use the NFT trait, assign unique unsigned integer IDs to tokens, enable minting, allow token transfers, and provide methods to access token metadata (URI) and owner information. The contract must control minting to a set total, employ owner restrictions, use a base URI for metadata, and include error management for unauthorized actions, transfer errors, and reaching the collection limit.","The task involves building a Clarity smart contract for a 'funny-dog' NFT. First, the nft-trait interface must be incorporated for ecosystem compatibility. Next, the NFT definition should be created, specifying unsigned integers as unique token identifiers. A data variable is needed to monitor the last minted ID to ensure token uniqueness. The contract creator should be given minting permissions, implying that the address of the contract deployer (tx-sender) should be saved as contract owner. For error handling, constants are needed to define various error conditions. Furthermore, a base URI variable will store template for retrieving token metadata. Read-only functions are needed so we can retrieve information about the last token ID, URI, and owner. A public function for token transfers should be constructed to ensure only the current owner can initiate a transfer. A minting function checks if the minter is the owner, enforces the collection limit, updates the token counter, and returns the new token ID. The COLLECTION_LIMIT constant will cap the number of tokens minted. The metadata retrieval function will return the URI template string rather than formatting the id in the URI for simplicity. Security is a crucial part, necessitating owner verification in transfer and limiting minting to the contract owner. This design fulfills the requirements by implementing the nft-trait, assigning uint identifiers, enabling minting, transfers, and metadata delivery, along with error handling and ownership restrictions.",";;title: funny dog

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for an NFT marketplace. This contract should enable users to list NFTs for sale, cancel active listings, and purchase NFTs using either STX or fungible tokens. It must incorporate error handling for situations such as out-of-date listings, unpermitted actions, and asset discrepancies. The contract should include a whitelist for asset contracts, validate listing information, and define secure functions for transferring both NFTs and fungible tokens. Prioritize a strong and effective execution, excluding code for deployment or testing.","First, establish the core functions: listing, canceling, and fulfilling NFT sales. Since both STX and FT payments are supported, distinct fulfillment functions are required. Utilize the NFT and FT traits for interacting with NFTs and fungible tokens. This approach promotes contract adaptability. Next, define the state management. A map to store listings is crucial, capturing details like seller, potential buyer, token ID, NFT contract, expiration time, price, and payment asset. Implement a nonce to generate unique listing IDs. A whitelist for asset contracts is essential for security, ensuring only verified contracts can be used. Implement comprehensive error handling with predefined error codes for scenarios such as expired listings and unauthorized actions. Listing functionality requires validating the asset whitelist, positive price, and payment asset whitelist. Transfer NFTs to the contract as escrow upon listing. Implement helper functions for NFT and FT transfers to simplify the main functions. The cancel function should verify the caller's authority and NFT contract match, returning the NFT to the seller if valid. Fulfillment requires separate functions for STX and FT, validating listing existence, caller authorization, listing expiration, and asset contract matching. Specifically, if a taker is defined, only the principal is authorized for fulfillment. Following validation, transfer the NFT to the buyer and payment to the seller. Ensure actions are performed by authorized parties, like only the contract owner modifying whitelists. Secure asset transfers, verifying conditions before transfers to prevent issues. The 'as-contract function' is crucial to allow the contract to initiate transfers. Define read-only functions for state retrieval to optimize gas usage. Provide comprehensive documentation and adopt proper naming conventions. The resulting implementation includes defining traits, setting up data structures for listings and whitelisting, implementing secure transfer functions, and providing detailed error handling. The contract supports listing with optional takers, expiration dates, and different payment methods, and should also ensure that all operations are secure and validated.",";;title: nft-marketplace

"Develop a Clarity smart contract named 'tiny-market', a decentralized marketplace where users can trade NFTs by generating functions to list, cancel, and fulfill trades. This contract should incorporate features like whitelisting asset contracts, storing and managing listing data such as the maker, taker, token ID, expiry, and price, and implementing rules for expiration, price and payment asset validation. Ensure the contract supports both STX and FT trading, enforces user permissions for actions such as canceling or fulfilling listings, and validates matching assets, and payment contracts. The implementation should use traits for NFT and FT standards, handle errors such as unauthorized access and expired listings, and offer helper functions for asset security.","We're tasked with creating a Clarity smart contract for a decentralized NFT marketplace, 'tiny-market'. This contract needs listing, canceling, and fulfillment capabilities, with support for STX and FT payments. Security demands rigorous validations and error handling. Therefore, we need mechanisms for expiry checks, price validation, and asset whitelisting. Traits for NFTs and FTs are essential to ensure standard compliance using the use-trait feature. A contract-owner is necessary for administrative tasks, especially asset contract whitelisting. Listing management forms a core part. We use a listings map, keyed by an integer, storing maker, taker, token ID, NFT contract, expiry, price and payment asset contract, all uniquely identified using a listing-nonce variable. To maintain integrity, we use a whitelisted-asset-contracts map to restrict trading to approved contracts only.

We'll need is-whitelisted, a read-only function to check if a contract is allowed for trading, and set-whitelisted for the contract-owner to manage this whitelist. Helper functions, namely transfer-nft and transfer-ft, will delegate transfer logic to asset contracts via contract-call?. The list-asset function will enable listing NFTs. This involves verifying whitelisting, ensuring expiry dates are in the future, and prices are positive, as well as whitelisting the payment asset if needed. We then transfer the NFT to the contract's custody and store the listing details, incrementing listing-nonce. The get-listing function enables retrieval of listing details. Cancel-listing allows makers to remove listings, validating the maker and confirming the NFT contract. Upon successful cancellation, the NFT returns to its owner.

To prevent fraud, we implement strict validation in fulfil-listing functions. The assert-can-fulfil function validates that the buyer is not the maker, that the taker (if any) is the caller, expiry hasn't passed, and that NFT and payment asset contracts are correct. Finally, we implement the fulfil-listing-stx and fulfil-listing-ft functions for STX and FT payments, respectively. Both functions retrieve the listing, validate conditions, transfer the NFT, transfer payment, and remove the listing. The use of try! guarantees atomic transactions, preventing partial execution and asset loss.

In short, this contract facilitates secure NFT trading through robust state management, whitelisting, and secure asset transfer.",";; title:tiny-market

"Develop a sophisticated Clarity smart contract for Stacks blockchain to operate a decentralized borrowing system enabling users to deposit STX tokens, secure loans using their holdings, and collect rewards. The contract should incorporate user-specific deposit tracking, a loan mechanism with interest rates tied to block progression, and reward distribution systems. Ensure a 50% loan-to-value restriction, 10% annual interest, and robust safeguards against over-borrowing, repayment failures, and other errors. Include public interfaces to retrieve user deposit balances and outstanding loan details, and enforce secure asset transfers using standard contract protocols. Add thorough documentation in comments outlining the function and purpose of every data structure and method within the contract.","Starting with the core requirements, the contract must handle STX-based lending with dynamic interest calculations and yield distribution. Data structures are designed using maps to track per-user deposits and loans, with block timestamps for interest tracking. Global variables track total deposits, interest reserves, and fixed rates. Borrow limits enforce 50% collateral ratios against deposited tokens. Key functions handle deposit intake using secure STX transfers, loan issuance with interest calculations, and repayments that update state and interest pools. The yield distribution function calculates proportional payouts based on deposit participation. Critical oversight reveals an incomplete loan ledger update in the borrowing mechanism which would inaccurately track accrued interest. Comprehensive query functions allow state inspection without modification. All logic adheres to the specified constraints: LTV thresholds, 10% APR compute formulas, and error conditions for repayment insufficiency and overextension.",";; Define the contract's data variables

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for the Stacks blockchain that establishes a basic NFT marketplace, enabling users to sell NFTs with adjustable parameters such as token ID, expiration time, sale price, payment type (STX or SIP010 tokens), and an optional specific buyer. The contract should support whitelisting of contracts, asset listings, listing cancellations, and purchase fulfillment using both STX and fungible tokens. Ensure robust error handling, security measures, and adherence to standard NFT and fungible token interfaces for interoperability.","## Analysis of NFT Marketplace Smart Contract Design

Initially, the requirements are analyzed: creating a marketplace where users can configure NFT sales with specific parameters. The contract must handle STX and fungible token payments, whitelisting, and secure state management. Technical considerations for Clarity’s constraints, such as type safety and atomic operations, are prioritized.

Storage design uses a map with unique IDs for listings, ensuring efficient access. A nonce increments to generate IDs, preventing duplicates. Security features include a contract whitelist controlled by the owner to restrict interactions with untrusted contracts.

Error handling employs distinct codes for clarity, categorizing issues by context (e.g., invalid listings, expired offers). Listing creation validates parameters, transfers NFT ownership to the contract, and records details. A retrieval function allows public access to listing data.

Cancellations require ownership verification and return assets to the seller. Fulfillment splits into STX and fungible token paths, sharing validation logic for taker eligibility, expiry, and asset matches. Helper functions abstract token transfers, enhancing code reuse and security via the as-contract context.

The payment process securely transfers funds from buyer to seller after NFT ownership is updated. Edge cases like unauthorized cancellations or expired listings are addressed through explicit checks. The design remains minimal, omitting fees but including atomic transactions to prevent partial execution. This structure balances simplicity with robustness, fulfilling all functional and security requirements.",";; A tiny NFT marketplace that allows users to list NFT for sale. They can specify the following:
;; - The NFT token to sell.
;; - Listing expiry in block height.
;; - The payment asset, either STX or a SIP010 fungible token.
;; - The NFT price in said payment asset.
;; - An optional intended taker. If set, only that principal will be able to fulfil the listing.

"Design a Clarity smart contract on the Stacks Blockchain adhering to the SIP-009 NFT standard, named 'Your-NFT-Name'. The contract must track the most recently minted token ID, enforce a 1000-token collection cap, and incorporate ownership verification. It requires a base URI for metadata, owner-specific constants, and custom error handling. Implement mandatory SIP-009 functions (like getting the last token ID, ownership info, and transfers) plus a limited owner-authorized minting function that returns newly created token IDs. Ensure all functions include proper security checks to prevent errors.","To create this contract, first enforce the SIP-009 trait for standard compatibility. Define an NFT with a token ID counter starting at zero, and a principal constant for the deployer as the owner. Implement error codes for exceeding limits and unauthorized actions. Use a mutable base URI string for metadata. The mint function must verify the caller's owner status, check the token cap before minting, increment the ID, and return the result. Transfer functions require sender verification via ownership checks. Each SIP-009 function follows required response formats, using assertions and error returns to ensure valid interactions.

"Design a Clarity smart contract for the Stacks Blockchain that incorporates the SIP-013 semi-fungible token standard, including the 'sip013-semi-fungible-token-trait' and 'sip013-transfer-many-trait' from 'SPDBEG5X8XD50SPM1JJH0E5CTXGDV5NJTKAKKR5V'. The contract must define a fungible token type, a non-fungible token ID system, and data structures for tracking balances and supplies. Include functions for single and batch transfers (with and without memos), balance inquiries, supply monitoring, and restricted minting to the owner only. Ensure proper error handling, access controls, and event logging while maintaining token ID ownership through a non-fungible tagging system.","Initially, I observe a substantial discrepancy between the user's request and the provided code. The question specifies implementing the SIP-009 NFT standard with a 1000-token collection cap and a named token, but the code instead implements SIP-013 semi-fungible tokens. This reflects a fundamental shift in the token standard's design. The code employs traits for semi-fungible functionality, allowing mixed fungible/non-fungible tracking via composite keys, unlike the pure NFT model requested. Missing features include the collection limit and sequential minting constraints. The implementation uses data maps for balance and supply tracking, appropriate for semi-fungible tokens but not for NFTs. Error handling focuses on ownership and balance checks but omits collection limits. The mint function enables owner-only issuance but lacks token ID counters required for sequential NFTs. The absence of a 'get-last-token-id' function further highlights divergence from SIP-009 requirements, while the code's hybrid ownership tagging aligns with SIP-013. Thus, the code effectively implements SIP-013 but doesn't fulfill the original NFT-based request.","(impl-trait 'SPDBEG5X8XD50SPM1JJH0E5CTXGDV5NJTKAKKR5V.sip013-semi-fungible-token-trait.sip013-semi-fungible-token-trait)

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for a bridged stablecoin on the Stacks blockchain adhering to the SIP-10 standard with extended bridging capabilities. Include governance features like owner permissions, minting limits, token pausing, and address restrictions. The token must support customizable metadata (name, symbol, URI), precise decimal precision, and secure core operations (transfer, mint, burn) with validation and error management. Add an extension mechanism enabling approved contracts to interact via a restricted API. Ensure all actions trigger audit events and return explicit error codes. The token should initially be paused until unlocked by the owner, and all critical functions must validate caller privileges before proceeding.","Initially, the contract integrates several traits to define its operational interfaces, starting with the SIP-10 standard for token interoperability. Bridging and extension traits are added to enable cross-chain interactions and future upgrades. Error codes are predefined with unique identifiers starting at u10000 to streamline debugging and maintain code clarity. State variables store metadata, balances (using fungible-token), minter allowances, and banned addresses for efficient state tracking. Security measures enforce owner-only access for high-risk functions, with the token starting in a paused state to prevent premature use. Minting uses dual allowance/usage tracking to prevent over-issuance. SIP-10 functions provide standardized access to token data, while internal transfer logic enforces bans and pausing. Administrative functions uniformly check permissions, execute changes, log events, and return status codes. The extension system allows whitelisted contracts to execute controlled operations via run-extension! with authorization checks. Comprehensive input validation and error handling ensure state consistency. Transfer operations include optional memo fields for compliance logging, emitted in events alongside transaction details.",";; title: circle-usdce-token

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for the Stacks blockchain that acts as a simple banking system or digital piggy bank. Users should be able to deposit and withdraw STX tokens, with balances stored in an account map. The contract must include secure deposit handling, multiple withdrawal methods demonstrating different security levels (including one intentionally insecure to teach risks), and allow administrators to access any account. Implement a time-restricted withdrawal feature that only works after a specified block height. Add clear documentation on security measures, input checks, error handling with constants, and use Clarity-specific safety tools like assertions and conditional guards.","The solution begins by outlining all user requirements: tracking STX balances via a data map, secure deposit/withdrawal logic with varying implementations, administrator privileges, time-based restrictions, and educational security explanations. The contract first defines error codes for clarity and consistency, fulfilling the error-handling directive. A 'user-accounts' map is set to store balances, directly addressing the balance-tracking requirement. Deposit functionality safely transfers STX while noting edge cases for atomicity. Three withdrawal approaches are created: an unsafe version omitting balance checks to illustrate risks, a standard method using assertions for validation, and a modular version using helper functions. A privileged 'admin-withdraw' accesses any account after verifying authentication. The time-based feature uses block-height checks against a predefined value to unlock funds. Read-access functions like 'check-balance' ensure transparency without altering state. Comments throughout explain dangers of unchecked inputs, the importance of atomic transfers, and security best practices in Clarity, such as using 'asserts' and 'cond' guards. Each function's design emphasizes contrasting safe vs. unsafe patterns to highlight development pitfalls.",";; bank

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for a fundraising initiative on the Stacks blockchain that accepts contributions in STX and sBTC tokens. The contract must include initialization parameters for a funding target and campaign timeline, with a default duration of 30 days (measured in Bitcoin blocks). It should record donations per donor address, permit the campaign manager to terminate the initiative, allow donors to seek refunds upon cancellation, and authorize the beneficiary to claim funds after the campaign concludes. Include error handling mechanisms, read-only functions to monitor campaign progress and contribution details, and strict permissions to ensure secure access. Maintain records of total funds raised, campaign status, and individual donation values.","Initially, the goal is to develop a fundraising contract for Stacks blockchain, requiring secure state tracking and transaction handling. The contract must store key information like initialization status, beneficiary identity, timeline details (duration and start), financial goals, and contribution data. This data is managed via variables and maps (for STX/sBTC donations indexed by contributor addresses). Defining error constants with clear codes (e.g., 'unauthorized-action' or 'campaign-expired') enhances readability and error reporting. The initialization method enforces authorization by the deployer, verifies unstarted campaigns, and sets parameters with a default 30-day timeframe (converted into BTC block numbers). Cancellation logic ensures only authorized users can halt active campaigns before funds are disbursed. Contribution methods for STX and sBTC confirm campaign activity, update balances, and log donations. Withdrawal can only occur after the deadline, via beneficiary authorization, transferring both token types securely. Refunds are processed only if canceled, returning saved donations while removing records. Read-only functions enable visibility into campaign status, individual contributions, and overall metrics. The structure ensures all requirements are fulfilled with robust security and state integrity.",";; Fundraising Campaign Contract

"Develop a Clarity-based smart contract for the Stacks Blockchain that enables a payment streaming system. The contract must permit users to establish sBTC payment streams that distribute funds incrementally from sender to recipient over a defined block count. Include features for initiating streams, adding funds to existing streams, allowing recipients to claim accrued payments, enabling senders to reclaim unused funds post-stream completion, and permitting parameter adjustments with mutual approval confirmed via cryptographic signatures. Maintain a data structure tracking stream details like sender, recipient, remaining balance, withdrawn amount, payment speed, and time parameters. Incorporate safeguards against unauthorized actions, signature mismatches, active stream interference, and invalid stream references. Also, include utility functions to compute available funds and block intervals.","First, I must grasp the contract's objective: creating a Stacks Blockchain payment streaming system using Clarity. The core idea involves transferring sBTC gradually over a block-defined timeframe instead of a single transfer. For state management, a mapping structure will track each stream's details using unique identifiers, managed by an incrementing ID counter. The 'create-stream' function will initialize parameters, lock sender funds, and return the stream ID, ensuring the sender is the transaction initiator. A 'refuel' function lets senders add funds to existing streams, validated against their identity. To track streamed amounts, helper functions calculate elapsed blocks and derived balances using payment rates and time boundaries. Recipients withdraw earnings via a 'withdraw' function verified against their address, while 'refund' allows senders to reclaim residual funds post-stream end. Stream parameter updates require both parties' cryptographic approval, enforced through signature validation of proposed changes. Error handling includes restrictions for unauthorized access, invalid signatures, active streams, and non-existent IDs. Read-only functions like 'balance-of' optimize gas costs by avoiding state changes. Token transfers use the sBTC contract interface, with the main contract acting as intermediary to ensure secure fund management throughout the stream lifecycle.",";; payment-stream.clar

Add error codes and documentation.","I begin by analyzing the requirement to build a STX time-lock contract with specific access controls. FirstStep: Defining contract structure and ownership logic using tx-sender as deployer. Next: Establishing error codes for all stated conditions: invalid owner actions, existing locks, past unlock heights, zero deposits, non-beneficiary operations, and premature claims. Variables: An optional principal for beneficiary allows null up front, while unlocking block is stored as numeric value. LockFn implements ownership checks, future block validation (time_cmp?), zero-check on deposits, and transfers STX to contract. BestowFn: Validates current beneficiary as sender before transferring entitlement. ClaimFn uses time comparison to confirm post-unlock, then transfers full balance to beneficiary using contract's own execution context.

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for a fungible token on the Stacks blockchain named 'Clarity Coin' with the symbol 'CC', adhering to the SIP-010 standard. The token must have no set maximum supply and restrict minting privileges exclusively to the contract owner.

This enforces the required token interface. Ownership is set by defining the deployer address as contract-owner. Error codes 'err-owner-only' (u100) and 'err-invalid-transfer' (u101) are established to handle access violations. The 'clarity-coin' token is created without a supply cap via the fungible-token! form. The transfer function validates the transaction sender matches the declared sender, executes the transfer using ft-transfer?, and processes memo via optional buffer handling. Read-only functions return static values for name/symbol, decimals (u0), and delegate balances/supply queries to standard functions.

The contract begins by importing the standard NFT interface to ensure compliance. Constants for the owner and errors are established upfront. Token IDs are managed via a data variable incremented during minting. Read accessors like get-last-token-id and get-owner provide state visibility. Transfer functionality enforces sender verification using asserts!, while minting restricts execution to the owner. The implementation avoids redundancy, uses error-returning functions for safety, and separates public (mint/transfer) from query functions as best practices dictate.","(impl-trait 'SP2PABAF9FTAJYNFZH93XENAJ8FVY99RRM50D2JG9.nft-trait.nft-trait)

"Develop a Clarity smart contract on the Stacks blockchain that fetches real-time price information for an asset, like BTC/USD, via the Stacks-Pyth Bridge.

Key constants for the Pyth Oracle and storage contract addresses, alongside the BTC/USD feed identifier in hex, must be defined using define-constant to ensure security and immutability.

Error management will rely on try! and unwrap! to handle errors from invalid feeds or outdated data. Deciding between a public or read-only function depends on whether Oracle calls require state changes. For clarity, define-public is likely optimal. The contract must incorporate the pyth-storage-trait for compatibility, while leveraging the pyth-decoder-trait to parse responses. Comprehensive inline documentation will explain each component’s role, including governance checks via pyth-governance-v2 and error propagation logic.

The transfer function must validate sender balances, while transfer-from checks both sender allowances and adjusts them post-transfer. Initial token allocation requires a minting function during contract deployment to distribute to specified addresses. Metadata such as name, symbol, decimals, and the provided IPFS URI should be accessible via getter functions. Error handling must enforce valid amounts and sufficient balances. The contract will use private helpers for allowance adjustments and public interfaces for user interaction, ensuring security and clarity.

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for a Stacks blockchain multisig wallet that supports owner administration (addition/removal with threshold validation), transaction submission/approval/cancellation, and cross-chain asset transfers via a bridge interface. Incorporate SIP-009/NFT and SIP-010/FT standards for asset handling, enforce permission controls through authorized caller lists, verify transaction approvals against ownership thresholds, and handle errors for conflicts, invalid inputs, and unauthorized operations. Organize the code with descriptive comments, data structures for tracking transactions/owners, and utility functions for state modifications, ensuring all critical functions include sender authentication and parameter integrity checks.","The contract constructs a multi-signature wallet (Multisafe) using Clarity on Stacks. First, it imports required interfaces defining execution rules, safe behavior, and token standards for NFTs/FTs, plus cross-chain bridge capabilities. By implementing the safe-trait interface, the contract establishes its role as a secure wallet. Error codes are defined to address authorization failures, transaction states, and other issues. The contract's principal (SELF) is used to enable self-referential operations. Core state variables include an owner list (capped at 20), approval threshold, and transaction counter. Owner management functions include strict validation to ensure threshold validity. Transactions follow a lifecycle: submission, confirmation, and execution, tracked via a detailed map. Security measures verify callers are contract owners or the contract itself. Cross-chain functionality integrates a bridge for escrow-based swaps. Initialization sets up initial owners and a 2-of-3 approval threshold. The design balances flexibility and security with a structured workflow for multi-party approvals and cross-chain interoperability.",";;title: safe-clar

"Design a Clarity smart contract for the Stacks blockchain that acts as a price oracle for BTC/USD rates, utilizing the Pyth Network’s pyth-storage-v3 contract. The contract must retrieve both current and historical prices using a specified feed ID, incorporate error handling with distinct codes, and support historical queries via block hashes or at-block parameters. It should interface with the sbtc-token contract to obtain sBTC total supply, normalize price and supply values (adjusted for 10^8 precision), and calculate the total sBTC value in USD. Ensure robust error management for external call failures, invalid inputs, and arithmetic overflows, while organizing the contract with read-only functions, strict type validation, and clear dependencies on external contracts.","The contract’s primary goal is to securely access Pyth Network price data and perform calculations with error resilience. The error-handling mechanism begins by assigning unique codes like `ERR_UNEXPECTED` (e.g., 5000) to systematically address unforeseen issues. To fetch live BTC prices, the `get-btc-price` function uses `contract-call?` to interact with Pyth, returning a wrapped value on success or `none` on failure. Historical price queries involve `get-btc-price-at`, which first retrieves a valid block hash via `get-stacks-block-info?`, then executes the price lookup at that block using `at-block`, maintaining consistent error handling. Integration with the sbtc-token contract occurs through `contract-call?`, safely obtaining sBTC supply. The `get-sbtc-total-usd-value` function combines normalized supply (divided by 10^8) with adjusted price data, multiplying them to compute USD value, while `unwrap!` ensures early termination on failed calls. The contract’s structure emphasizes read-only operations for safety, type-checked parameters to prevent overflow or invalid data, and modular design for maintainability, with all external dependencies explicitly declared.","(define-constant ERR_UNEXPECTED (err u5000))

"Develop a Clarity smart contract to manage a counter with the following features: establish constants for specific error identifiers, maintain state variables for count, contract owner, and operation cost, provide read-only access to the current count and historical count at a given block, and include public methods to adjust the counter (increment, decrement, add) while enforcing rules like non-negative counts, restricting additions beyond one unit, and collecting STX payments according to the cost variable.","First, constants for error codes must be declared to standardize error handling, such as ERR_COUNT_MUST_BE_POSITIVE for invalid decrements and ERR_ADD_MORE_THAN_ONE to block excessive increments. Additionally, ERR_BLOCK_NOT_FOUND addresses failed block history queries. These constants improve code clarity and consistency. Next, state variables are initialized: count (starting at zero), contract-owner (set to the deploying address), and cost (fixed at 10 STX). Public functions like increment require STX transfers via stx-transfer? before updating the count, while decrement includes a check using asserts! to prevent negative values. The add function enforces that the input exceeds one and calculates total fees (n * cost). Read-only functions use var-get for current count and at-block with block header lookups for historical data, returning errors if blocks are missing. All operations return ok upon success to confirm execution, ensuring users receive clear responses.

"I require a Clarity-based smart contract that validates Bitcoin transactions by cross-referencing transaction details with a merkle proof and the corresponding block header. The contract must also process witness data for SegWit transactions, implement robust error handling for potential failures, and enforce strict constraints on data lengths throughout its execution.","To begin, I must clarify the contract's requirements: it must verify Bitcoin transactions using Clarity by validating merkle proofs against block headers, support SegWit witness data, and include error handling for anomalies. This requires expertise in Bitcoin's transaction structure and Clarity's limitations. First, define error codes for scenarios like invalid proofs, buffer overflows, or malformed data to enhance code clarity. Next, develop helper functions to parse Bitcoin's variable-length formats, such as varints and byte arrays, ensuring proper handling of endianness conversions. Transaction parsing functions will decode version, inputs, outputs, and locktime, while SegWit-specific logic will process witness commitments. Block header parsing extracts essential fields for merkle root verification. Merkle proof validation involves reconstructing the root from provided hashes and comparing it to the header's root. SegWit validation requires checking the witness commitment in transaction outputs. The contract must enforce data size limits via Clarity's buffer constraints to prevent overflow. Finally, design user-facing functions to encapsulate verification steps, ensuring deterministic execution and error propagation through Clarity's strict operational limits.",";; title: stateless contract to verify bitcoin transaction

"Design a Clarity smart contract for an NFT collection that includes functionality such as defining a non-fungible token, managing token identifiers, handling ownership records, and enabling minting and transferring tokens. The contract should include error codes for scenarios like unauthorized actions or invalid transactions, incorporate a base URI for token metadata, and validate Bitcoin transaction confirmation via an external clarity-bitcoin-lib-v5 library. The minting process must increment the token ID, confirm the sender is the contract owner, verify the Bitcoin transaction was successfully mined, and assign the token to the recipient. The transfer process must restrict initiation to the token owner and update ownership accurately.","First, I'll determine the requirements. The task involves constructing an NFT contract with specific features like ownership, minting, and Bitcoin validation integration. To ensure standard compliance, implementing an NFT interface through a recognized trait in Clarity is necessary. Error handling is crucial for cases such as unauthorized minting attempts or rejected Bitcoin transactions. State variables like the next token ID, ownership records, and a base URI for metadata must be declared. The mint function's logic requires incrementing the token ID, checking sender authority, validating Bitcoin transaction confirmation via the external library, and minting the token. The transfer function needs strict ownership verification before allowing transfers. The Bitcoin tx validation step will rely on the specified library's functionality. Functions should return appropriate success or error statuses, with error constants covering unauthorized access, invalid IDs, or failed tx validations.",";;title: btc-tx-enabled-nft

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for a fungible token compliant with the SIP-010 standard, ensuring inclusion of all required functions and constants. The contract must implement the SIP-010 trait, establish a token named 'count-token', define error constants for unauthorized owner actions and non-owners, set the contract owner as the transaction deployer, introduce a mutable TOKEN-URI variable initialized with a default value, and declare constants for the token's name, symbol, and decimal places. Include read-only methods to fetch balances, total supply, metadata, and URI, along with public functions to update the URI (owner-only), mint fixed amounts to the sender via a .counter contract, burn tokens or STX if insufficient balance, and transfer tokens between accounts with an optional memo while enforcing ownership validation.","To create this SIP-010-compliant fungible token contract, I first confirm the SIP-010 trait implementation, which aligns with Stacks' fungible token standard. The 'define-fungible-token' directive will establish the 'count-token' type. Error constants like ERR_OWNER_ONLY (u100) and ERR_NOT_TOKEN_OWNER (u101) are designated to handle permission issues. The contract owner is set to tx-sender at deployment. A mutable TOKEN-URI variable, initialized with a placeholder string, allows future updates. Constants for name, symbol, and decimals (e.g., 'Count Token', 'COUNT', and a specified decimal value) define core metadata. Read-only functions are implemented to expose balance, total supply, and metadata. Public functions include set-token-uri (owner-restricted), a mint function restricted to the .counter contract, a burn function with STX fallback, and a transfer function verifying sender authority, managing memos, and adhering to SIP-010 transfer logic. Permission checks ensure only authorized parties can execute critical operations, with URI updates and minting tied to specific conditions.",";;title:count-token

"I require a Clarity smart contract that enables an off-chain payment channel system for STX and SIP-010 tokens, incorporating features such as channel creation, termination, dispute resolution, signature validation, nonce tracking, and payment distribution, while prioritizing security and performance standards in the Stacks blockchain environment.","First, I must analyze how payment channels function within the Stacks ecosystem and their operational flow. These channels enable low-cost, off-chain exchanges between users, reducing on-chain activity and costs. Key steps include establishing a channel with initial deposits, managing multiple transactions via signed updates, and finalizing balances on-chain. The contract must address core operations like channel initialization, state updates, dispute mechanisms, and secure closure. Security is critical, requiring rigorous signature validation to authenticate transactions. For state tracking, the contract needs to store participant details, balance allocations, expiration timers, and nonces to thwart replay attacks. Supporting both native STX and SIP-010 tokens demands a flexible design using traits. Channel identification should use a standardized key derived from participant addresses to ensure uniqueness. Signature protocols aligned with SIP-018 will prevent misuse across different contracts. The lifecycle functions must include cooperative and unilateral closure options, dispute resolution with timelocks, and escrow management for safe fund distribution. Edge cases like inactive participants or invalid state transitions require safeguards like forced timeouts and strict validation checks. Nonce increments, HTLC support for conditional payments, and event logging for monitoring are also essential. The contract must validate balance consistency during updates and implement clear error handling to enhance reliability and user clarity.",";; title: stackflow 
;; summary: Stackflow is a payment channel network built on Stacks, enabling
;;   off-chain, non-custodial, and high-speed payments between users. Designed
;;   to be simple, secure, and efficient, it supports transactions in STX and

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for a subnet infrastructure that supports miner management, registration of both fungible and non-fungible token contracts, block commitment with withdrawal roots, STX and token deposit/withdrawal processing, Merkle proof validation for verification, and secure asset transfers or minting, following the example structure provided.","To begin, I'll review subnet mechanics in blockchain systems—subnets allow decentralized processing separate from the main network. The contract must enable cross-chain coordination between mainnet and subnet. First, define error identifiers for block submissions, invalid participants, asset validation failures, and transfers to enhance error management. Design state-tracking structures like block records, withdrawal root storage, and withdrawal tracking maps. An authorized miner account will secure block proposal rights.
Contract interaction with external tokens requires defining standardized interfaces for fungible/non-fungible assets and a minting rule for subnet-originated assets. Miner replacement must be permissioned solely to existing miners. Asset contract registration (via the miner) maps L1-L2 contract relationships.
Block commits must include fresh withdrawal roots and chronological checks. For assets, STX and tokens require deposit logic (transfers to this contract) and withdrawal fulfillment after Merkle proof verification. NFT withdrawals may require minting if the token isn’t locally held. Fungible token balances need careful management to handle mint/burn logic during withdrawals.
Merkle validation functions must hash STX/fungible/non-fungible leaf nodes uniquely, then validate proof paths against stored roots. Each withdrawal’s leaf must be claimed exactly once with processing tracking. Implement strict preconditions in all functions to block invalid operations and double-spends. Emit events for traceability during critical operations to enable off-chain tracking.",";;title: subnet

"Design a Clarity smart contract for an NFT called 'funny-dog' that adheres to the nft-trait interface, uses a uint type as its unique token identifier, and incorporates minting, ownership transfer, and metadata retrieval functions. The contract must restrict unapproved actions, stop minting exceeding a set maximum, and utilize a base URI for metadata. Include safeguards against unauthorized operations, invalid transfers, and over the collection capacity.","To develop the Funny-Dog NFT contract, begin by adopting the nft-trait interface to ensure compatibility with ecosystem standards. Define the NFT with a 'define-non-fungible-token' command specifying uint identifiers. Track the next available token ID via a counter initialized at zero. Establish ownership by capturing the contract deployer's address as the owner. Declare error codes for unauthorized access, transfer errors, and cap breaches. Store a mutable base URI for metadata. Create read-functions to retrieve token metadata (URI, owner) using built-in lookups. Implement a transfer method verifying sender ownership before execution. Craft a minting function checking ownership, remaining capacity, executing minting, and updating the counter. Enforce the fixed collection size using a constant. Though placeholder token IDs could be dynamically appended to base URIs, the current setup meets core functional requirements. Each step ensures security controls and specification adherence.",";;title: funny dog

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for a decentralized marketplace named 'tiny-market' to enable users to create, revoke, and execute NFT trading offers. The contract must handle whitelisting asset contracts, track listing details (seller, buyer, token ID, expiry time, cost), enforce validity rules such as expiry checks, cost accuracy, and payment type restrictions. It must process transactions using STX or fungible tokens (FTs), validate correct permissions for actions like revoking offers, ensure matching asset and payment contracts, utilize traits for NFT and FT compliance, include error handling for issues like access violations or expired offers, and provide utility functions to ensure safe asset transfers.","First, it is essential to establish a smart contract framework that supports NFT trade creation, cancellation, and fulfillment within a decentralized marketplace. The design requires security features for STX/FT transactions, including validation mechanisms and permissions management. Initial steps involve declaring NFT and FT traits via use-trait to interact with standardized protocols, while restricting administrative controls to the contract owner for contract whitelisting decisions. A listings registry is created using a mapping, indexed by unique IDs generated through a nonce counter. Only whitelisted asset and payment contracts are permitted in transactions to mitigate risks. Helper methods for NFT/FT transfers are defined first to handle inter-contract operations safely. Listing submissions are validated by checking contract whitelisting, valid expirations, and non-zero prices before escrowing assets. Cancellation logic requires confirming the user's ownership and returning assets upon success. A separate validation utility centralizes checks for fulfilling offers (e.g., proper buyers, expiry status). Fulfillment pathways for STX-based and FT-based payments divide transaction handling, ensuring funds are transferred only after executing required validations and state updates. Security measures like atomic operations via try! blocks ensure all steps complete fully or roll back entirely, protecting assets from partial transfers. This structure balances functionality with rigorous security constraints to deliver a secure, cross-contract compatible marketplace system.",";; title:tiny-market

"Re-express the prompt for creating a Clarity smart contract on the Stacks blockchain. The contract should be a decentralized lending protocol where users can deposit STX, borrow against their deposits, and earn yield.  The contract needs to manage user deposits, handle loans with interest based on block height, and give yield to depositors. The loan-to-value ratio is 50%, the interest rate is 10%, and there should be error handling for situations like over-borrowing and repayment problems. Include functions to check balances and loan amounts. All STX transfers must be secure.","Re-explain the thought process behind creating the Clarity smart contract. Begin by outlining the protocol: a decentralized lending platform on Stacks using STX. The core features are deposit handling, collateralized borrowing, loan management, and yield distribution.

Describe the data structures. For deposits and loans, use maps linking user addresses to deposit amounts, and borrower addresses to loan amounts and last interaction block height (for interest calculation), respectively.

Detail global variables:  `total-deposits` for aggregate deposit tracking (for yield calculation), `pool-reserve` for accumulated interest (yield source), and `loan-interest-rate` (set at 10%).

Explain error constants for clear user feedback on failures.

Outline the `deposit` function: users add STX, updating the `deposits` map and `total-deposits`.

Detail the `borrow` function, enforcing the 50% loan-to-value ratio. Describe calculating permissible borrowing based on half the user's deposit. Calculate and include accrued interest via a private function (`calculate-accrued-interest`), updating the loan record and block height.

Explain the `repay` function: calculate the total due (including interest), ensure no overpayment, transfer the repayment, update the loan record, and add interest to the `pool-reserve`.

Detail the `claim-yield` function, distributing accumulated interest to depositors proportionally based on their share of total deposits.

Describe read-only functions (`get-balance-by-sender`, `get-balance`, `get-amount-owed`) for transparency.

Explain the private function `calculate-accrued-interest`: calculate interest based on elapsed blocks since the last interaction, applying the 10% rate. Identify and note correction of error in original borrow function, the new-loan now computes accurately and it includes the existing loan amount along with the accrued interest during the accounting. Conclude by summarizing adherence to requirements: deposits, loans with dynamic interest, yield distribution, 50% LTV, 10% interest, error handling, and read-only functions.",";; Define the contract's data variables

"Design a Stacks blockchain smart contract using Clarity that creates a basic NFT marketplace. This marketplace should allow users to sell NFTs with customizable settings such as token ID, expiration date, price, accepted payment method (STX or SIP010 tokens), and an optional specific buyer.  The contract must include features for adding authorized contracts to a whitelist, creating listings, removing listings, and completing sales using both STX and fungible tokens. Ensure the implementation includes error management, security measures, and adheres to the standard traits for NFTs and fungible tokens.","The task is to build an NFT marketplace smart contract on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity. The contract's key features should include listing NFTs with user-defined parameters (token ID, expiry, price, payment asset type, and optional intended buyer), whitelisting contracts, managing assets (listing, canceling), and processing transactions using STX and fungible tokens. First, define the core data structures: a map for listings (keyed by unique integer IDs) storing all configurable parameters, a nonce for generating unique listing IDs, and a whitelist map. Implement whitelisting with owner control.  Handle errors using specific error codes and categories.  Implement the main functions: `list-asset` (validating, transferring NFT, recording listing), `get-listing` (retrieving listing details), `cancel-listing` (maker authorization, NFT contract verification), `fulfill-listing-stx` (STX payment), and `fulfill-listing-ft` (fungible token payment).  Both fulfillment functions should share validation logic (`assert-can-fulfil`: buyer/maker check, taker check, expiry check, asset contract check). Use helper functions (`transfer-nft`, `transfer-ft`) to simplify and abstract token transfers. Use `as-contract` for secure token transfers on behalf of the contract.  Payment processing should handle both STX (`stx-transfer?`) and fungible tokens (via `transfer-ft`).  The transaction flow should be: validation, NFT transfer, payment processing, and state update (listing removal).  Handle edge cases like expired listings and unauthorized actions. Ensure atomicity and prevent partial execution. The contract described does not include fees and is a minimal implementation.  Finally, it's a fully functional but basic implementation, meeting all specified requirements.",";; A tiny NFT marketplace that allows users to list NFT for sale. They can specify the following:

;; - An optional intended taker. If set, only that principal will be able to fulfil the listing.

"Develop a SIP-009 compliant NFT smart contract in Clarity for the Stacks blockchain.  The NFT, called ""Your-NFT-Name"", should have a maximum supply of 1000, track the ID of the most recently minted token, and include a configurable base URI for metadata.  The contract deployer should be designated as the owner.  Implement all standard SIP-009 functions (get-last-token-id, get-token-uri, get-owner, transfer) and a mint function. The mint function should be callable only by the contract owner, respect the maximum supply, assign the newly minted token to a specified recipient, increment the token ID, and return the new ID.  Include error handling and assertions for security and to enforce contract rules.","Begin by implementing the SIP-009 trait to ensure the contract conforms to the NFT standard on Stacks. Define the NFT ""Your-NFT-Name"" with unsigned integer token IDs. Use a data variable, initialized to zero, to track the last minted token ID, ensuring uniqueness. Define constants for the contract owner (tx-sender), the collection limit (1000), and error codes for unauthorized access and exceeding the collection limit.  Include a string variable for the base metadata URI. Implement the required SIP-009 functions: get-last-token-id (returns the current token ID counter), get-token-uri (constructs the metadata URI for a given token), get-owner (uses nft-get-owner? to determine token ownership), and transfer (allows token transfers, verifying the sender's ownership).  The transfer function must include an assertion to prevent unauthorized transfers. The mint function should increment the last token ID, verify the collection limit hasn't been reached, and confirm the caller is the contract owner. If all checks pass, mint the token using the appropriate Clarity function to the recipient, update the last token ID, and return the new token ID. Ensure all functions return correctly formatted responses according to SIP-009, using (ok ...) for read-only functions and try!/asserts! for error handling and validation in state-changing functions.",";; This contract implements the SIP-009 community-standard Non-Fungible Token trait

"Create a Clarity smart contract for the Stacks Blockchain. This contract should be a SIP-013 compliant semi-fungible token, implementing both the 'sip013-semi-fungible-token-trait' and 'sip013-transfer-many-trait' from 'SPDBEG5X8XD50SPM1JJH0E5CTXGDV5NJTKAKKR5V'.  The contract needs a fungible token, a system for unique non-fungible token IDs, and mappings for balances and total supplies. It must include functions for single and multiple transfers (with and without memos), checking balances, getting supply information, and minting which is restricted to the owner. Ensure there's proper error handling, restricted access where appropriate, and event logging. Token ID ownership should be managed using the non-fungible token tagging approach.","The question and supplied code represent different token standards. The question describes features of a SIP-009 NFT (specifically mentioning a collection limit and token name), but the code implements a SIP-013 semi-fungible token. The 'sip013-semi-fungible-token-trait' and 'sip013-transfer-many-trait' are used in the code, not SIP-009.  The code handles semi-fungible tokens, using ""semi-fungible-token"" (fungible) and ""semi-fungible-token-id"" (non-fungible, with a composite key) to let users possess varying quantities of unique token IDs, a contrast to simple NFT ownership. The code lacks the question's 1000-token collection limit, allowing unrestricted minting. Data maps store token balances and supplies, fitting the semi-fungible model where users hold multiple of the same token ID. Error handling covers ownership ('err-owner-only') and balance checks ('err-insufficient-balance'), but not collection limits. Transfer functions verify the sender, ensuring security.  The code implements necessary SIP-013 functionalities, including batch transfers ('transfer-many' and 'transfer-many-memo'), not initially requested but part of SIP-013. The owner-restricted mint function doesn't enforce NFT-style sequential IDs or limits, instead allowing any token ID and amount. The question's 'get-last-token-id' function (crucial for sequential NFT minting) is absent.  A 'tag-nft-token-id' helper function manages the non-fungible aspects, creating a hybrid system tracking quantity (fungible) and ownership (non-fungible). Overall, while the code correctly implements SIP-013, it contradicts the question's SIP-009 NFT requirements, particularly regarding sequential minting and collection size limitation.","(impl-trait 'SPDBEG5X8XD50SPM1JJH0E5CTXGDV5NJTKAKKR5V.sip013-semi-fungible-token-trait.sip013-semi-fungible-token-trait)

"How can we design a Stacks smart contract in Clarity for a stablecoin that can be bridged, adhering to the SIP-10 standard? This contract should include features for bridging, owner control, minting limits, pausing the token, banning addresses, and configurable token details (name, symbol, URI, decimals). It must support standard token operations (transfer, mint, burn) with security and error handling. An extension system should allow authorized contracts to interact with the token. All actions should trigger events, have error codes, start paused, and ensure only authorized callers can execute sensitive functions.","The contract begins by defining several traits, including SIP-10 for standard token functionality and custom traits for bridging and extensions, enabling interaction with other systems. Error codes are defined as constants for maintainability, starting at u10000 for easy identification. State is managed using data variables and maps. Metadata like name and symbol are stored, while token balances utilize the built-in fungible-token type. Maps track minter allowances and banned addresses. Security is enforced through owner checks for sensitive operations. The token starts paused, requiring owner activation. Minting uses a dual-map system for allowances and usage tracking. SIP-10 functions provide standard read-only access and a `transfer` function using an internal `transfer!` with added checks. Administrative functions consistently verify authorization, execute, emit events, and return success. Banned addresses are prevented from transfers. The extension system authorizes and revokes external contracts, and `run-extension!` executes extension code with the token's authority. Error handling, using `unwrap!` and `match`, prevents inconsistencies. Memo support in transfers adds context for compliance.",";; title: circle-usdce-token

"Develop a Stacks blockchain smart contract in Clarity that simulates a basic banking system (a ""piggy bank"").  Users should be able to deposit and withdraw STX, with the contract keeping track of their balances.  The contract should include several withdrawal methods, each showcasing different security approaches (one intentionally insecure for demonstration).  It must also have a read-only function to check balances, administrative functions for a designated bank owner to withdraw from any account, and a time-locked withdrawal option that becomes available after a specific block height. The contract should be well-commented, explaining security best practices, input validation, error handling, and how Clarity's security features are used.","The piggy bank contract needs to fulfill several key requirements. It must track user balances and allow deposits and withdrawals of STX. The question specifies multiple withdrawal methods with different security levels (and an explanation of security considerations), including an insecure case. Administrative control and time-locked withdrawals are also needed.

The contract starts with error constant definitions for common failure scenarios: insufficient balance and unauthorized access.

User balances are managed using a data map called ""accounts,"" mapping principals to their respective balances.

The deposit functionality retrieves the existing balance, adds the new deposit, updates the map, and transfers STX to the contract. The STX transfer handles underflow.

Multiple withdrawal methods are provided. An intentionally unsafe version lacking balance checks is included as a negative example. Three secure implementations follow: one using assertions (""withdrawal""), one using conditional logic (""withdrawal-if""), and one delegating validation to a helper function (""withdrawal-callee-filter"").

A read-only ""get-balance"" function allows for balance inquiries.

Administrative features include a ""bank-owner"" variable and a ""take"" function.  This allows the owner to withdraw from any account with proper authorization checks.

A time-locked withdrawal feature (""take-after-time"") is enabled after a specified block height (""expiration-height"").

Extensive comments explain security, including input validation, security warnings, and annotations. Assertions, conditional checks, and functions like `filter()` and `allow()` are used to demonstrate secure practices.

In summary, all requirements are met—tracking balances, handling deposits/withdrawals (multiple, with variance in security levels), checking balances, an administrative function, time-locked withdrawals, and detailed educational comments.",";; bank

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for a Stacks-based fundraising campaign that accepts STX and sBTC. The contract should allow setting a goal and duration (defaulting to ~30 days in Bitcoin blocks), track donations per donor, permit the owner to cancel the campaign, enable donor refunds upon cancellation, and allow the beneficiary to withdraw funds after the campaign ends. Include error handling, getters for status and donation details, and authorization checks for all functions. The contract should store data on total donations, status, and individual contributions.","The goal is to create a Stacks fundraising contract with robust state management for donations, campaign status, and secure transactions.

The contract needs data variables to store initialization status, cancellation status, withdrawal status, beneficiary, start time, duration, goal, and total donations.

Donations must be tracked per donor using maps, one for STX and one for sBTC, keyed by the donor's principal.

Error constants should be defined for readability and easier debugging, providing informative feedback on failures.

The `initialize-campaign` function should only be callable by the owner, prevent re-initialization, and set campaign parameters, offering a default duration option (~30 days in Bitcoin blocks).

`cancel-campaign` needs authorization checks, should only work on initialized campaigns, and must prevent cancellation after fund withdrawal.

Separate donation functions are required for STX and sBTC. These functions must check if initialized & active, that the campaign is still running, then transfer funds, record the donor's contribution, and update the total.

`withdraw` needs authorization (beneficiary only), should require the campaign to be active, not withdrawn, and past its end date. It handles STX and sBTC transfers.

A refund mechanism should work only if the campaign is cancelled, returning respective assets and removing donation entries.

Read-only getter functions will provide access to donation specifics, campaign details, and contract balance without any side effects. All intended functionality such as campaign lifecycle(initialization, cancellation, running, ended, withdrawn), donations in multiple currencies(STX, sBTC), withdrawals, and refunds with suitable checks and maintains states, appears implemented.",";; Fundraising Campaign Contract

The contract needs to store stream data (sender, recipient, balance, withdrawals, rate, and timing) and include error handling for unauthorized actions, incorrect signatures, active stream refunds, and invalid stream IDs. Provide helper functions for balance calculations and block difference computations.","The contract's objective is to create a Stacks Blockchain payment streaming protocol using Clarity. This protocol allows for the incremental transfer of sBTC over a specified block duration, instead of a lump-sum transfer. A mapping will store stream details like sender/recipient, balance/withdrawn amounts, rate, and time. A unique ID generator using an incrementing variable ""latest-stream-id"" is neeeded.  Key functions include ""stream-to"" (create stream, transfer sBTC, initialize parameters), ""refuel"" (add sBTC to an existing stream by the sender), ""calculate-block-delta"" (compute elapsed blocks within the stream's timeframe) and ""balance-of"" (determine available funds for sender/recipient based on elapsed time and rate), ""withdraw"" (recipient claims accumulated sBTC), and ""refund"" (sender retrieves sBTC after stream completion). ""update-details"", needs combined with ""hash-stream"" and ""validate-signature"" to allow modifications to strem details, requiring cryptographic signatures from both sender and recipient for authorization. Comprehensive error handling, distinct codes for various failure scenarios, and read-only functions for gas optimization (e.g., balance checks) are needed.

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for the Stacks blockchain named 'timelocked-wallet'. This contract should function as a time-locked wallet, enabling the owner to deposit STX tokens for a beneficiary, which become claimable only after a specified future block height.

Include comprehensive error handling to manage access control, prevent double-locking, ensure future unlock heights, check token amounts, and prevent early withdrawals. The contract should also have data variables to keep track of the beneficiary and the time they can withdraw.","The task is to create a Clarity smart contract for a time-locked wallet on Stacks.  This requires understanding Clarity and Stacks blockchain specifics (principals, STX transfers, block heights). The core functions are 'lock' (owner deposits STX, sets beneficiary and unlock height), 'bestow' (beneficiary transfers rights), and 'claim' (beneficiary withdraws after unlock height). The contract starts with comments describing its function. The contract owner is set to `tx-sender` at deployment.  Error constants are defined for clarity and easier debugging, covering all specified requirements. Data variables track the beneficiary (optional principal, initially none) and unlock height (uint, initially zero). The 'lock' function checks that the caller is the owner, no beneficiary exists yet, the unlock height is in the future, and the amount is positive. It transfers STX, sets beneficiary and unlock height, and returns `ok`. 'Bestow' lets the beneficiary transfer rights, checking that the caller is the beneficiary before updating the variable. 'Claim' lets the beneficiary withdraw after the unlock height, ensuring the caller is the beneficiary and the block height is sufficient. It gets contract token balance with `stx-get-balance` then makes withdrawal using `stx-transfer?` as contract itself. `unwrap-panic` is safely to get the principal from the optional. All error checks use the predefined error constants.

Develop a Stacks smart contract in Clarity that fetches the current BTC/USD price from the Pyth Network via the Stacks-Pyth Bridge. Provide instructions for deploying and testing the contract.,"The objective is to build a Clarity smart contract that obtains the live BTC/USD exchange rate from the Pyth Network by utilizing the Stacks-Pyth Bridge. This involves integrating with the Pyth Network on Stacks, likely using traits like `pyth-storage-trait` and `pyth-decoder-trait`. The process will include:

1.  Defining constants for contract addresses (Pyth Oracle, storage contract) and the BTC/USD feed ID (32-byte hex).
2.  Creating a main function that invokes the `get-price` method of the Pyth Oracle contract, supplying the feed ID and storage contract address.
3.  Using `as-contract` if necessary, similar to previous use cases of `as-contract PYTH-STORAGE; to ensure the storage contract operates under the correct context, as context is crucial for price data extraction.
4.  Implementing error management, like `try!` and `unwrap!`, to address scenarios such as incorrect storage addresses or outdated data. Likely use a public function to handle and propagate the errors and responses.
5. Choose between define-read-only and define-public given the get-price implementations. Since a public function was used for handling errors and results, we use define-public.
6.  Integrating the `pyth-storage-trait` for storage contract interaction and ensuring correct constant usage.

7.  Ensure our function handles all potential contract call related errors.
8.  Supplying comprehensive documentation, explains governance checks with `pyth-governance-v2`, the reason for using `as-contract` and the response types from the Oracle.
9. Use a testable and maintainable, blueprint for fetching the BTC/USD price using a modular structure.",";; Pyth Oracle integration for BTC/USD price feed

"Develop a Clarity smart contract for a Stacks multisig wallet. This wallet should support managing owners (adding/removing, subject to threshold constraints), handling transactions (submission, confirmation, revocation), and facilitating cross-chain token swaps using a 'magic bridge' interface.  The contract should integrate with SIP-009 (NFT) and SIP-010 (FT) traits for asset transfers. Implement access control via permitted callers, verify transaction confirmations against the owner threshold, and handle errors such as ownership conflicts, incorrect parameters, and unauthorized actions.  The code should be well-commented, use data maps for transactions and owners, and include helper functions for updating internal state, ensuring that sender authentication and parameter checks guard crucial operations.","The requested code represents a multi-signature wallet (Multisafe) implemented in Clarity for the Stacks blockchain. The fundamental concept is a secure wallet where multiple confirmations are necessary before transaction execution.  The contract begins by importing required traits, defining how it interacts with executors, safes, NFTs, FTs, and a 'magic bridge' for cross-chain operations. The contract implements 'safe-trait,' thus behaving as a safe.  Error constants are defined to cover various scenarios, including those related to authorization and transactions.  The contract utilizes a constant `SELF` to refer to its own principal allowing it to function as an autonomous entity. The contract maintains data on wallet owners (up to 20), a confirmation threshold, and a transaction nonce—critical for the multisig design.  Owner management is provided through add and remove functions, including security checks. The confirmation threshold's integrity is checked to be greater than zero but not more than the number of owners.  Transaction handling is implemented through submission, confirmation, and execution, where each transaction's details and confirmations are stored and managed. Owners can submit, confirm, or revoke these confirmations.  Most of the functions are secured by checks to limit actions to either the contract itself or registered owners.  A `magic bridge` integration handles cross-chain operations, letting designated users create and perform swaps. The contract initialization configures its owners and defines its threshold. In the given example, it sets three initial owners with a confirmation requirement of any two amongst the group. The contract is designed to be a secure multisig wallet with specialized cross-chain functionality.",";;title: safe-clar

"Create a Clarity smart contract for a counter that includes: error code constants; variables for count, owner, and cost; read-only functions for viewing the count (current and at a specific block); and public functions for increasing, decreasing, and adding to the count, with checks for positive counts, single increment restriction, and required STX payments based on the cost.","First, define error code constants for readability and maintainability (e.g., ERR_COUNT_MUST_BE_POSITIVE, ERROR_ADD_MORE_THAN_ONE, ERR_BLOCK_NOT_FOUND). Next, set up mutable state variables using define-data-var:  count (initialized to 0), contract-owner (initialized to tx-sender), and cost (initialized to 10 STX).  Then, create read-only functions: get-count to return the current count, and get-count-at-block to return the count at a particular block, fetching the block's header hash using get-stacks-block-info?, returning ERR_BLOCK_NOT_FOUND if not found.  After that, define public functions: increment to increase the count by one after a successful STX transfer (stx-transfer?) of the cost to the owner; decrement to decrease the count by one, aborting with ERR_COUNT_MUST_BE_POSITIVE if the count is already zero; and add to increase the count by a value 'n', ensuring 'n' is greater than one (asserts!, ERROR_ADD_MORE_THAN_ONE) and that an STX transfer of n * cost is made.

"How can we create a Clarity smart contract that validates Bitcoin transactions? This contract should use merkle proofs to verify transaction inclusion in a block, check these against a provided block header, handle SegWit transactions with witness data validation, manage potential errors effectively, and enforce strict data length limits.","The goal is to build a Clarity smart contract for verifying Bitcoin transactions.  This involves confirming transaction details using merkle proofs and block headers, handling SegWit transactions, and implementing thorough error checking. The process is broken down as follow:

1.  **Error Handling:** Define error codes for different failure scenarios like invalid proofs, buffer size issues, etc. making certain the contract manage several failure points.
2.  **Data Parsing:** Develop helper functions to read Bitcoin data types. Given transactions utilize variable lengths, several readers will be needed. These include readers for fixed-size integers (read-uint8, read-uint16, read-uint32, read-uint64), variable-length integers (varints), and variable-length byte arrays (varslices).  Little-endian to big-endian conversion (e.g., reverse-buff32) will also be needed.
3.  **Transaction Parsing:** Create `parse-tx` and `parse-wtx` functions. The former handles standard transactions (version, inputs, outputs, locktime), and the latter also handles SegWit's witness data.  Both should adhere to Bitcoin's data format and check for data consumption issues.
4.  **Block Header Parsing:**  Implement `parse-block-header` to extract key block header fields (version, previous block hash, merkle root, timestamp, bits, nonce) to connect transactions to specific blocks.
5.  **Merkle Proof Verification:** Build a function to validate merkle proofs. This involves hashing node pairs up the tree until the merkle root is reached.  Compare this calculated root against the block header's merkle root.
6.  **Mock Data (Testing):**  Include a mechanism (like a map) to mock blockchain data during testing.
7.  **SegWit Verification:** Address SegWit transactions. Functions should be provided to examine the commitment placed on witness data. These will need extra step to validate both inclusion and witness data.
8.  **Overall Verification Flow:**  Establish the main verification process: block header validation, merkle proof check against the block's merkle root, and witness commitment verification (for SegWit).
9.  **API Functions:** Provide user-facing functions like `was-tx-mined-compact` (regular transactions) and `was-segwit-tx-mined-compact` (SegWit transactions) for simplified usage.
10. **Buffer Size Limits:** Enforce strict buffer size checks due to Clarity's limitations.
11. **Execution and Error Handling:**  Use `try!` and `unwrap!` to manage errors and ensure deterministic execution within Clarity's non-Turing complete environment.

Overall, the smart contract efficiently parses and validates Bitcoin transaction data, checks cryptographic proofs, and deals with potential issues within the bounds of the Clarity environment, all needed for a verified mechanism.",";; title: stateless contract to verify bitcoin transaction

"Create a Clarity smart contract for an NFT collection. This contract should manage token IDs, ownership, minting, and transferring of tokens. It should include error handling for unauthorized access and other issues. It should also use a base URI for metadata and verify Bitcoin transaction mining status using an external library (clarity-bitcoin-lib-v5). The minting process should check if the sender is the contract owner, confirm the Bitcoin transaction, and then mint to the recipient. Transfers should only be allowed by the token owner.","The task is to build a Clarity smart contract for an NFT collection. This involves several key steps. First, implement the standard `nft-trait` for interoperability. Define error constants for scenarios like unauthorized access, transfer issues, and Bitcoin validation failures. Use contract variables to store the NFT definition, the last used token ID, and a base URI for metadata. Implement public functions: `mint` (which increments the token ID, verifies the sender is the owner, uses `clarity-bitcoin-lib-v5` to validate a Bitcoin transaction, and mints the token), and `transfer` (which checks ownership before transferring). Include read-only functions to get the token URI and owner. The Bitcoin transaction verification adds a cross-chain element. The `mint` function is the most complex, using a `let` for organization. Robust error handling is crucial, with functions returning appropriate error codes on failure. The `transfer` function must prevent unauthorized transfers by verifying ownership. Return values should follow Clarity's response structure (success or error). The final contract will manage NFTs, track IDs, handle ownership, enable minting linked to Bitcoin transactions, and provide secure transfers.",";;title: btc-tx-enabled-nft

2.  **Define Fungible Token:** Create the token itself using `define-fungible-token` and naming it 'count-token'.
3.  **Error Constants:** Define error constants (`ERR_OWNER_ONLY`, `ERR_NOT_TOKEN_OWNER`) for access control and error handling.
4.  **Contract Owner:** Set `CONTRACT_OWNER` to `tx-sender` to record the deployer.
5.  **Token URI (Mutable):**  Use `define-data-var` for a mutable `TOKEN-URI` (optional string) to store and update the token's URI.
6.  **Token Constants:** Define  `TOKEN_NAME`, `TOKEN_SYMBOL`, and `TOKEN_DECIMALS`.
7.  **Read-Only Functions:** Implement SIP-010's required read-only functions: `get-balance`, `get-total-supply`, `get-name`, `get-symbol`, `get-decimals`, and `get-token-uri`.
8.  **Public Functions:**
    *   `set-token-uri`:  Allows the contract owner to update the `TOKEN-URI`.
    *   `mint`:  Mints a specific amount to sender.
    *   `burn`:  Burns tokens from user account along with condition to burn STX if token does not exit.
    *    `transfer`: Implements the SIP-010 `transfer` function, handling an optional memo and verifying sender authorization. Make sure that there is check on permission for transfer function.

"Create a Clarity smart contract for a payment channel system on the Stacks blockchain. This system should facilitate off-chain transactions using both STX and SIP-010 tokens. The contract must include functions for opening, closing (cooperatively and non-cooperatively), disputing, and finalizing channels. It should also incorporate robust security measures, such as signature verification (following SIP-018) and nonce management to prevent replay attacks. The contract should manage payouts, ensure adherence to Stacks ecosystem best practices, and consider the implementation of features such as HTLCs for advanced use cases, and an agent system for delegating transactions.","The process begins with conceptualizing payment channels and their operation within Stacks. Payment channels enable off-chain transactions, improving efficiency and reducing fees. Key stages include channel opening with initial deposits, off-chain transactions via signed messages, and channel closure with on-chain settlement. The contract will require functions to manage channel opening, state updates, disputes, and closure, secured with signature verification. Channel state, including participant details, balances, expiry, and nonces (to prevent replay attacks), must be meticulously tracked. The design should define constants, error codes, and data structures. Support for both STX and SIP-010 necessitates a trait for token-agnostic operations. Deterministic channel identification will be achieved by sorting participant principals. Following SIP-018 is needed for strong security. Critical functionalities include contract initialization, channel funding, cooperative and unilateral closure, dispute handling (with timelocks), and deposit/withdrawal management, and an agent system. A challenge period will be incorporated for dispute resolution. Robust signature verification, covering all relevant data, is required for each state update. An edge case that needs consideration, is handling unresponsive participants with a force-close mechanism and timeouts. Invalid state transitions must be prevented through validation. Payment execution requires escrowing and accurate fund distribution during closure. HTLCs should be considered for conditional payments. Strict nonce management is essential. Maps with composite keys will store channel data. Utility functions will improve maintainability. Specific error constants will enhance debugging. Security measures must prevent unauthorized fund access, ensuring balance consistency. Events (print statements) will allow off-chain monitoring. Withdrawals during the channel's lifetime should be allowed. The contract's aim is to balance security, efficiency, and usability, offering a solid framework to support off-chain interactions.",";; title: stackflow

"Create a Clarity smart contract for a subnet. This contract should manage miners, register fungible and non-fungible tokens, commit blocks including withdrawal Merkle roots, handle STX, fungible token, and non-fungible token deposits and withdrawals (validating with Merkle proofs), and either transfer or mint assets as required. Base the implementation on the provided code example's structure and logic.","1. **Define Subnet:** Understand that a subnet is a secondary blockchain linked to a main chain, enabling specialized transactions and scaling. The contract will facilitate asset movement between the main chain (L1) and the subnet (L2).

2. **Error Constants:** Define error constants for various failure scenarios (block commits, invalid miner, transfer failures, validation problems) to provide clear error messages.

3. **Data Structures:** Establish maps for tracking committed blocks, withdrawal roots, and processed withdrawals to maintain subnet state and prevent double-spending.  Include a variable for the authorized miner.

4. **Token Traits:** Define traits for interacting with NFTs, fungible tokens, and a custom minting trait to ensure standardized interaction with various token contracts.

5. **Miner Management:** Implement a function to update the miner, restricted to the current miner, ensuring only authorized parties commit blocks.

6. **Token Registration:** Create functions to register fungible and non-fungible token contracts (L1 to L2 mapping), restricted to the authorized miner.

7. **Block Commitment:** Implement block commitment functionality, anchoring the subnet's state to the main chain.  Each commit should include a withdrawal root (Merkle root of withdrawals).  Validate block novelty and miner authorization.

8. **NFT Handling:** Implement NFT deposit (record event) and withdrawal (validate Merkle proof, transfer NFT) functions.

9. **NFT Minting:** Include logic to mint NFTs during withdrawal if the contract doesn't own the NFT, covering cases where the NFT originated on the subnet.

10. **Fungible Token Handling:** Implement fungible token deposit (record event) and withdrawal (validate Merkle proof, transfer tokens) functions, including amount handling.  Include minting logic if necessary.

11. **STX Handling:** Create specific functions for STX deposits and withdrawals using `stx-transfer?`, maintaining similar validation but adapted for the native token.

12. **Merkle Proof Validation:** Implement functions for hashing withdrawal data consistently, verifying the Merkle path, and tracking processed withdrawals to prevent double spending.

13. **Leaf Hashing:** Create distinct leaf hashing formats for STX, NFT, and FT withdrawals to generate unique identifiers for the Merkle tree.

14. **Hash Verification:** Develop logic to reconstruct the root hash by traversing the Merkle tree with sibling hashes, comparing the result to the committed withdrawal root.

15. **Withdrawal Processing:** Implement a function to mark withdrawals as processed after successful execution, preventing replay.

16. **Error Handling:**  Ensure thorough error handling throughout the contract, validating inputs and state before operations, and providing specific error codes.

17. **Event Emission:** Ensure the contract emits events for key operations like deposits and withdrawals for off-chain observability.

18. **Comprehensive Design:**  The overall design should meet the requirements of a subnet, encompassing robust asset management and security measures.",";;title: subnet

"Create a Clarity smart contract for an NFT named 'funny-dog'. This NFT should adhere to the `nft-trait` interface, use unsigned integers as unique identifiers, and support minting, transferring, and retrieving metadata (token URI and owner). The contract must manage ownership, limit the total number of tokens, use a base URI for metadata, and handle errors like unauthorized actions, bad transfers, and exceeding the token limit.","Design a Clarity contract for the 'funny-dog' NFT collection, following the `nft-trait` standard. Begin by implementing the `nft-trait` interface. Define the NFT using `define-non-fungible-token`, with `uint` identifiers. Track the last minted token ID with a data variable, initialized to 0. Store the contract owner's address in a constant. Define error constants for unauthorized access, invalid transfers, and exceeding the collection limit. Store the base URI template as a data variable. Create read-only functions for the last token ID, token URI, and token owner. Implement a public transfer function that verifies the sender's ownership. Create a mint function, restricted to the contract owner, that checks the collection limit, mints the token, updates the token counter, and returns the new ID. Include a `COLLECTION_LIMIT` constant. The initial metadata function will return just base URI. Ensure to include all security mentioned.",";;title: funny dog

"Create a Clarity smart contract for a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace. This marketplace should enable users to offer NFTs for sale, remove their listings, and buy listed NFTs using either STX or other compatible tokens. The contract must handle errors such as listings that have passed their expiration date, actions attempted by users without permission, and situations where the wrong assets are involved. It should also include a feature to approve specific asset contracts, verify the details of each listing carefully, and have secure functions for moving NFTs and tokens. The emphasis is on building a reliable and effective contract; deployment and testing parts are not required.","Begin by outlining the core needs of an NFT marketplace: creating listings, removing listings, and purchasing items. Support for both STX and fungible tokens (FTs) necessitates separate purchase handling for each. Define standard traits for NFTs and FTs to ensure compatibility. Manage the marketplace state using a map for listings, storing details like seller, potential buyer, token ID, NFT contract, expiration, price, and payment asset. A counter will generate unique listing IDs. Implement a whitelist for asset contracts to enhance security. Define error codes for various failure scenarios, such as expired listings or unauthorized actions. For listing creation, ensure the NFT and payment asset (if any) are whitelisted, and the price is valid. Transfer the NFT to escrow upon listing. Create helper functions for secure NFT and FT transfers. For listing cancellation, verify the caller's authorization and return the NFT. For purchases (fulfillment), create distinct functions for STX and FT payments, checking listing validity, caller authorization, expiration, and asset contracts. Ensure exclusive fulfillment by a designated buyer, if specified. Transfer the NFT to the buyer and payment to the seller upon successful validation. Include security checks to ensure only authorized actions. Use `as-contract` for contract-initiated asset transfers. Mark read-only functions appropriately to save on gas costs. Provide informative names, and thorough commenting and docstrings to improve maintainability. The implementation involves defining traits, creating data structures, implementing secure transfers, and handling errors. It supports specifying buyers, expiration times, and payment methods, while ensuring security, validation, and authorization.",";;title: nft-marketplace

"Create a Clarity smart contract named 'tiny-market' for a decentralized NFT marketplace. This contract should enable users to list NFTs for sale, cancel listings, and complete trades. It needs to support transactions using STX or fungible tokens (FTs). Key features include: whitelisting NFT contracts, managing listings (including maker, taker, token ID, expiry, price, and payment details), checking expiry and prices, restricting payment assets, ensuring correct permissions, using traits for NFT and FT interactions, handling errors (e.g., unauthorized access, expired listings), and providing secure asset transfer functions.","The contract design process begins by outlining the core needs: listing, canceling, and fulfilling NFT trades, supporting STX and FT payments, and ensuring security.  We achieve this through validations, error handling, expiration checks, price validation, and whitelisting of NFT and payment asset contracts. We start by defining NFT and FT traits via `use-trait` for standard interactions.  A `contract-owner` is set for administrative tasks, like whitelisting.  Listings are stored in a map with details: maker, optional taker, token ID, NFT contract, expiry, price, and optional payment asset contract, uniquely identified using a `listing-nonce`.  A `whitelisted-asset-contracts` map restricts tradable assets. `is-whitelisted` checks if a contract is allowed, and `set-whitelisted` manages the whitelist. Helper functions, `transfer-nft` and `transfer-ft`, handle asset transfers using `contract-call?`. `list-asset` allows listing, validating whitelist status, expiry, price, and payment asset, then transfers the NFT to contract custody. `get-listing` retrieves listing details. `cancel-listing` allows the maker to remove a listing, verifying ownership and contract, then returning the NFT.  Complications in fulfilling listings are handled by `assert-can-fulfil`, which checks buyer/maker differences, taker match, expiry, and contract correctness. `fulfil-listing-stx` and `fulfil-listing-ft` handle STX and FT payments respectively.  They retrieve listings, validate, transfer NFT and payment, and remove the listing, using `try!` for atomic transactions. In essence, the contract enables secure NFT trading via robust state management, whitelisting, and secure transfers.",";; title:tiny-market

"Design a Clarity smart contract for the Stacks blockchain that implements a decentralized lending protocol where users can deposit STX tokens, borrow against their collateral, and earn yield. The contract should include functions for managing deposits with individual user balances, a loan system with dynamic interest calculations based on block height, and a mechanism for distributing yield to depositors. The contract should enforce a 50% loan-to-value ratio, a 10% interest rate, and handle errors such as excessive borrowing and repayment issues. Include read-only functions for querying user balances and outstanding loan amounts. Ensure that all STX transfers are handled securely using the appropriate contract-based transaction patterns. Provide detailed comments for each data structure and function in the contract.","To solve for a decentralized lending protocol on the Stacks blockchain, the Clarity smart contract should include the following main components:

1. **Data structures to keep track of user deposits and loans.**
2. **Global variables for total deposits and pool reserves.**
3. **Functions for depositing STX tokens into the contract.**
4. **Functions for borrowing against deposited STX tokens with a 50% loan-to-value ratio limit.**
5. **Functions for repaying loans including a 10% interest rate calculated based on block height.**
6. **Functions for distributing yield to depositors based on their share of total deposits.**
7. **Read-only functions for querying user balances and outstanding loan amounts.**
8. **Error handling for various scenarios such as excessive borrowing and repayment issues.**

Based on this reasoning, here is a step-by-step reasoning process for the Clarity smart contract:

#### Step 1: Define constants and error codes.

clarity
;; Define constants for error codes
(define-constant ERR-INVALID-AMOUNT (err u1001))
(define-constant ERR-INSUFFICIENT-BALANCE (err u1002))
(define-constant ERR-INSUFFICIENT-DEPOSIT (err u1003))
(define-constant ERR-EXCESSIVE-BORROWING (err u1004))
(define-constant ERR-NO-LOAN (err u1005))
(define-constant ERR-OVERPAYMENT (err u1006))
(define-constant ERR-NO-DEPOSIT (err u1007))

;; Define constants for loan-to-value ratio (50%) and interest rate (10%)
(define-constant LOAN_TO_VALUE_RATIO (/ u1 u2)) ;; 50% loan-to-value ratio
(define-constant INTEREST_RATE u1000) ;; 10% interest rate (represented as 1000 for calculations where 1000 means 10%)


#### Step 2: Define data maps and global variables.

clarity
;; Data maps to keep track of user deposits and loans
(define-map deposits principal uint)
(define-map loans principal (tuple (amount uint) (last-block-height uint)))

;; Global variables for total deposits and pool reserve (for yield distribution)
(define-data-var total-deposits uint u0)
(define-data-var pool-reserve uint u0)


#### Step 3: Implement the `deposit` function.

clarity
;; Function to deposit STX tokens into the contract
(define-public (deposit (amount uint))
    (begin
        (try! (stx-transfer? amount tx-sender (as-contract tx-sender)))
        (let ((current-balance (default-to u0 (map-get? deposits tx-sender))))
            (map-set deposits tx-sender (+ current-balance amount))
            (var-set total-deposits (+ (var-get total-deposits) amount))
            (ok u1)
        )
    )
)


#### Step 4: Implement the `borrow` function.

clarity
;; Function to borrow against deposited STX tokens with a 50% loan-to-value ratio
(define-public (borrow (amount uint))
    (begin
        (let (

            (max-loan (/ user-deposit u2)) ;; 50% loan-to-value ratio
            (current-loan (map-get? loans tx-sender))
        )
            (asserts (> user-deposit u0) ERR-INSUFFICIENT-DEPOSIT)

                    (map-set loans tx-sender (tuple (amount amount) (last-block-height block-height)))
                    (as-contract (stx-transfer? amount (as-contract tx-sender) tx-sender))

                )
                    (asserts (<= new-loan max-loan) ERR-EXCESSIVE-BORROWING)
                    (map-set loans tx-sender (tuple (amount new-loan) (last-block-height block-height)))
                    (as-contract (stx-transfer? amount (as-contract tx-sender) tx-sender))
                    (ok u1)
                )
            )
        )
    )
)

;; Private function to calculate accrued interest based on block height
(define-private (calculate-accrued-interest (principal uint) (last-block uint))
    (let (
        (elapsed-blocks (- block-height last-block))
    )
        (/ (* principal INTEREST_RATE elapsed-blocks) u10000)
    )
)


#### Step 5: Implement the `repay` function.

clarity
;; Function to repay a loan including a 10% interest rate based on block height
(define-public (repay (amount uint))
    (begin
        (let (

                (accrued-interest (calculate-accrued-interest principal last-block))
                (total-due (+ principal accrued-interest))
            )
                (asserts (<= amount total-due) ERR-OVERPAYMENT)
                (try! (stx-transfer? amount tx-sender (as-contract tx-sender)))
                (if (= amount total-due)
                    (map-delete loans tx-sender)
                    (map-set loans tx-sender (tuple (amount (- total-due amount)) (last-block-height block-height)))
                )
                (var-set pool-reserve (+ (var-get pool-reserve) accrued-interest))
                (ok u1)
            )
        )
    )
)


#### Step 6: Implement the `claim-yield` function.

clarity
;; Function to claim yield based on the user's share of total deposits
(define-public (claim-yield)
    (begin
        (let (
            (user-deposit (default-to u0 (map-get? deposits tx-sender)))

                (ok u1)
            )
        )
    )
)


#### Step 7: Implement read-only functions for querying user balances and loan amounts.

clarity
;; Read-only function to get the balance of the sender
(define-read-only (get-balance-by-sender)
    (default-to u0 (map-get? deposits tx-sender))

                (accrued-interest (calculate-accrued-interest principal last-block))
            )
                (ok (+ principal accrued-interest))
            )
            (ok u0)
        )
    )
)

;; Read-only function to get the amount owed by a given principal
(define-read-only (get-amount-owed (user principal))
    (let (

            (ok u0)
        )
    )

This Clarity smart contract should now cover all the required functionalities such as depositing STX tokens, borrowing against collateral with a 50% loan-to-value ratio, repaying loans with a 10% interest rate based on block height, and distributing yield to depositors based on their share of total deposits. The read-only functions allow users to query their balances and outstanding loan amounts. The contract handles errors such as insufficient deposits, excessive borrowing, and overpayment during loan repayment.

This reasoning process makes sure that the contract is well-documented and follows the given requirements.",";; Define the contract's data variables

"Design a Clarity smart contract for the Stacks Blockchain that enables a payment streaming protocol. The contract should allow users to establish sBTC payment streams where funds are gradually transferred from a sender to a recipient over a defined block period. The contract should support creating new streams, adding funds to existing streams, withdrawing accumulated funds (for recipients), refunding unused funds (for senders once the stream ends), and updating stream parameters such as recipient, payment rate, and block period with mutual consent verified by cryptographic signatures. The contract should keep a record of streams including sender, recipient, total balance, withdrawn amount, payment rate, and block period details. Implement error handling for unauthorized access, invalid signatures, active streams, and non-existent stream IDs. Additionally, include helper functions to compute available balances and block deltas.","To solve for a Clarity smart contract that implements a payment streaming protocol for the Stacks Blockchain, the main components should include a data structure for storing stream information, functions for creating, refueling, withdrawing, and refunding streams, and functions for updating stream parameters with mutual consent verified by cryptographic signatures. The plan includes defining a stream structure with fields such as sender, recipient, balance, withdrawn amount, rate (sBTC per block), start block, and stop block. A map called `streams` should store stream information indexed by a unique stream ID. A data variable called `latest-stream-id` should keep track of the latest stream ID. The `stream-to` function should create a new stream where the `contract-caller` is the sender. The `refuel` function should allow the sender to add more sBTC to an existing stream. The `withdraw` function should allow the recipient to withdraw sBTC based on the block delta and payment rate. The `refund` function should allow the sender to reclaim any remaining sBTC once the stream has ended. The `update-details` function should allow both the sender and recipient to update stream parameters such as recipient, rate, start block, and stop block if both parties agree (verified by cryptographic signatures). Helper functions such as `calculate-block-delta` should calculate the block delta (number of blocks that have passed since the stream started until the current block or until the stop block if the current block is past the stop block), and `balance-of` should calculate the available balance for withdrawal by the recipient and the remaining balance that could be refunded to the sender. Another helper function called `hash-stream` should create a hash of the stream details for signature verification, and `validate-signature` should verify that a given signature corresponds to a given public key and a given hash.",";; payment-stream.clar

"Please generate a Clarity smart contract that implements a subnet system with functionalities for managing miners, registering new fungible and non-fungible token contracts, committing blocks with withdrawal roots, handling deposits and withdrawals of STX, fungible tokens, and non-fungible tokens while ensuring proper validation through Merkle proofs, and performing safe transfers or minting of assets as needed, based on the structure and logic demonstrated in the provided code snippet.","To solve for a Clarity smart contract that implements a subnet system, the contract should include the following functionalities:

1. **Managing miners**: The contract should allow for the management of authorized miners who can commit blocks and register new token contracts.
2. **Registering new fungible and non-fungible token contracts**: The contract should allow the authorized miner to register new fungible token (FT) and non-fungible token (NFT) contracts for both the main chain (L1) and the subnet (L2).
3. **Committing blocks with withdrawal roots**: The authorized miner should be able to commit blocks which include a withdrawal root (a Merkle root of all withdrawals included in that block).
4. **Handling deposits and withdrawals of STX, fungible tokens, and non-fungible tokens**: The contract should handle deposits where users transfer assets (STX, FTs, or NFTs) to the contract for use in the subnet. For withdrawals, the contract should validate a Merkle proof against a committed withdrawal root and then transfer the asset back to the user on the main chain.
5. **Ensuring proper validation through Merkle proofs**: The contract should verify Merkle proofs for withdrawals to ensure that a given withdrawal was indeed included in a committed block.
6. **Performing safe transfers or minting of assets as needed**: If the contract does not have enough balance for a withdrawal, it should be able to mint new tokens (if the token contract supports minting) or handle the transfer of existing tokens.

Based on the provided question, here is a Clarity smart contract that implements a subnet system with the described functionalities. The contract includes error constants, data structures, traits for token interactions, miner management, block commitment, asset registration, and handling deposits and withdrawals for STX, fungible tokens, and non-fungible tokens.

This Clarity smart contract provides a basic structure for a subnet system where miners can commit blocks with withdrawal roots, and users can deposit and withdraw STX, fungible tokens, and non-fungible tokens. The contract makes use of Merkle proofs to validate withdrawals and ensures that only authorized miners can commit blocks and register new token contracts. The `verify-merkle-proof` function is a helper function that verifies a Merkle proof given a leaf and a root hash. 

This contract should be tested thoroughly and might need additional error handling and optimizations based on the specific use case and security requirements.",";;title: subnet

"Create a Clarity smart contract for an NFT marketplace where users can list NFTs for sale, cancel listings, and fulfill listings using either STX or fungible tokens. The contract should handle errors for expired listings, unauthorized actions, and asset mismatches. Implement whitelisting for asset contracts, validate listing details, and define functions for secure NFT and fungible token transfers. Focus on a robust and efficient implementation without including deployment or testing components.","To solve for an NFT marketplace, the contract should support listing NFTs for sale, canceling listings, and fulfilling listings with either STX or fungible tokens. The contract should include error handling for expired listings, unauthorized actions, and asset mismatches. Whitelisting should be implemented for asset contracts to ensure only verified contracts are used. The contract should validate listing details such as the seller (maker), potential buyer (taker), token ID, NFT contract, expiration time, price, and payment asset contract. A nonce should be used to generate unique listing IDs. The contract should verify that the NFT asset is whitelisted, the price is positive, and the payment asset (if specified) is also whitelisted. The NFT should be transferred to the contract as escrow until the listing is fulfilled or canceled. Helper functions should be defined for transferring NFTs and fungible tokens securely. The cancellation function should verify that the caller is the maker of the listing and that the NFT contract matches. For fulfillment, separate functions should handle STX and FT payments, verifying that the listing exists, the caller is not the maker, the listing hasn't expired, and the asset contracts match. If a specific taker is set, only that principal can fulfill the listing. After validation, the NFT should be transferred to the buyer and the payment should be sent to the seller. The contract should ensure that only authorized parties can perform actions such as modifying the whitelist (only the contract owner) and canceling listings (only the maker). The contract should verify all conditions before making any transfers to prevent partial executions that could lead to asset loss. The as-contract function should be used when the contract needs to transfer assets it holds. Read-only functions should be defined for reading state without modifying it to optimize gas costs. The contract should be well-documented and follow proper naming conventions for maintainability.",";;title: nft-marketplace
