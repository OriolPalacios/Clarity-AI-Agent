# Clarity-AI-Agent

## Overview

Clarity-AI-Agent is a project aimed at enhancing the development of decentralized applications (dApps) by fine-tuning AI models to assist developers in writing smart contracts using the Clarity language. The project focuses on data augmentation techniques to enrich a dataset containing questions, chain-of-thought (CoT) processes, and code responses, which are then utilized to fine-tune the deepseek r1 model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).

## Purpose

This repository is designed to perform data augmentation on a dataset comprised of:
- Questions
- Chain of Thought (CoT)
- Responses (code)

The augmented dataset will be used to apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning on the deepseek r1 model. The ultimate goal is to build an AI agent that assists developers in building decentralized applications (dapps) using Clarity for smart contracts.

## Tools

The following tools and libraries are used in this project:
- **Pandas**: For dataset manipulation and processing
- **OpenAI API**: For generating additional training data
- **PyTorch**: For model training and fine-tuning
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For working with the deepseek r1 model
- **PEFT**: For efficient LoRA fine-tuning techniques
